# openminutes

This is a repository of minutes and similar open records from U.S. local governments, districts, etc. When possible, transcripts are given in Markdown or another format. The goal is to catalog them all, transcribe them all, and apply structured data to them. Realistically, the true goal is to automate 99% of this process leaving humans to do the harder (but less frequent) cleanup.

Ultimately, I want this repository to serve as the basis for an open source reader app. Can you imagine if even the smallest municipalities, school districts, etc., were all made available for inspection via the same API? I think LLMs finally enable humans to accomplish this.

The purpose of each transcript is to increase the accessibility of the original document. It should be semantically identical, and emphasis (such as bolds, italics, etc.) should be preserved unless technically infeasible or unless it interferes with semantics. Obvious typos (such as misspellings of councilmembers' names) should be fixed. Markdown is the current transcript format.
