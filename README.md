# openminutes
This is a repository of minutes and similar open records from U.S. local governments, districts, etc. When possible, transcripts are given in Markdown or another format. The goal is to catalog them all, transcribe them all, and apply structured data to them. Realistically, the true goal is to automate 99% of this process leaving humans to do the harder cleanup.
