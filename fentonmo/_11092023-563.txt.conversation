Public Works Director Dan Howard replied it is both,\nthere have been       some repairs and more to            be completed, per agreement with GameTime.                     Alderman\nJokerst had inquired on Soccer Field Lighting project of $500,000, she thought this was voted down by\nthe Board. Alderman Jokerst had inquired on Heroes Memorial Redesign and Native planting project of\n$5,000, is it ongoing and why does it have to be redesigned. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner replied,\nHeroes     Memorial      Redesign     and   Native    planting    project    was   request    by the     Parks   and    Recreation\nCommittee.\n\nAlderman Maserang shared he recalled Alderman Jokerst had requested information on available grants\nfor the Soccer Field Lighting project.             City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner shared Staff is                  researching\navailable grants.     Alderman Maserang expressed he feels                 if grants are available discussion of lighting\nproject could be revisited. Mayor Maurath inquired if the project was voted down. City Administrator\nNikki Finkbiner shared the Bill for Musco Field Lights did not pass and noted if requested by the Board,\nthe project could be removed from the Capital Projects budget.\n\nMayor Maurath shared he was not in favor of the soccer field lights, giving up a soccer field and will be\ndifficult to maintain. Alderman Wisbrock inquired how that related to giving up a soccer field. Mayor\nMaurath stated it would not be available to Fenton residents as it would be utilized by outside groups and\nfeels the expense does not benefit Fenton residents, who would pay for the lights. If lights are installed it\n\n\n                                                           Budget Hearing\n                                                          November 9, 2023\n\f\nencourages a constant barrage of play on the soccer fields. Is that what City wants to do with the City\nparks?\n\nAldennan Maserang shared the bid received was for approximately $330,000 not $500,000 and noted that\ncurrently the soccer fields are not utilized at night as they are not lit and dark. He feels lighted fields are in\nhigh demand and would not have problems renting them if they were lit. If the fields were not rented the\nlights would not be on. The people renting the fields would pay for the lights. Alderman Maserang shared\nthe softball fields are lit and there are no problems with fields being rented with lighting. Public Works\nDirector Dan         Howard      stated currently there          is one (l) soccer field          with    lights at the      Fenton Sports\nComplex that is rented from 5-9 p.m. every night. Other organizations have called trying to reserve the lit\nfield;   however,       it is booked out.        He further      shared there are four (4) organizations that would                      have\nutilized the soccer fields if they were lit.\n\nAldennan Cruts inquired how much is                      the rental fee      for lit soccer field.       Public Works Director Dan\nHoward rep Iied $25 per hour for field                  rental and $10 per hour for lighting.               He further shared that St.\nLouis Scott Gallagher - Club Soccer and St. Paul's Association currently rent the lit soccer field almost\nyear-round for four ( 4) hours per night. Aldennan Clauss asked if St. Paul's received a discount on that\nfield. Public Works Director Dan Howard replied no - not the lit field.\n\nMayor Maurath           stated    he   feels   the   soccer fields      are   not   in good     shape,     there   is no    irrigation,    and\ncontinuous play on them if they were lit would increase the wear on the fields. He feels the rental fee\nwould not recoup the cost of installing lights, there has not been an analysis. Alderman Maserang shared\ntypical seasonal use of soccer field for leagues is fall and they would not be utilized during growing\nseason. Alderman Maserang stated if the only reason the City has parks is to make money, the parks\nshould be closed as the City does not make money from                             parks, they are a service for the community.\nDiscussion ensued on increase of rates for rental if approved.\n\nAldennan Clauss shared the City provides leaf pick up, yard waste, trash pick-up, and snow removal to\nresidents at no cost to the residents nor do they make money for the City. She feels this is a service\nprovided with no anticipation to make money.\n\nAlderman Bereitschaft voiced if approved he feels operational costs should be within fees for recoupment\nfor the lighting.\n\nAldennan Maserang and Aldennan Huels voiced they feel if there is grant money available the project\nshould remain in the Capital budget.\n\nMayor Maurath shared he feels                 the Capital      project for     FSC     LED lighting for         $1,500,000       is not   cost\neffective. Public Works Director Dan Howard shared the project is mainly for connect link in the lighting\nsystem for ability for control from off-site. He has recently found out the current system can be connected\nto the link and inquiring about quotes.\n\nAldennan Cruts shared he thought the pay adjustments for Public Works were not approved and inquired\nwhy they were in the budget. Mayor Maurath stated he had reviewed draft minutes, and it was motioned\nand approved for the adjustments to be in the 2024 budget.\n\nMayor Maurath asked Financial Consultant Tammy Alsop how she arrived at the four percent (4%) for\nwage increases. Financial Consultant Tammy Alsop replied conservative percentage based on inflation\nand cost of living. Mayor Maurath asked the Board if there were any concerns with a four percent (4%)\nwage increase for eligible employees. There were no objections.\n\n\n                                                                Budget Hearing\n                                                              November 9, 2023\n\f\n          Mayor Maurath stated he would rather have a flat dollar amount across the board for wage increase\n          instead of percentage and feels the Board should consider that option.\n\n          Financial Consultant Tammy Alsop reminded the Board that seven (7) employees will be at the maximum\n         of their pay grade this year and will not receive their full raise. Alderman Clauss asked if pay grades\n          increased as cost of living and inflation increases each year. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner stated no,\n         currently if employee reaches their maximum, they do not receive increase. The Board would need to\n         approve a pay grade increase. The last pay grade adjustment was made in 2018 through CBIZ study.\n         Financial                Consultant Tammy                                Alsop            shared            CBIZ sends a                         recommendation each year for suggested\n         increase to pay range, however, there has been no adjustments.\n\n         Mayor Maurath shared in relation to maxing out on pay grade, he feels caps should be eliminated. If the\n         bar (target) keeps moving and being raised, why have it. Alderman Clauss voiced pay ranges cannot be\n         kept at the same rate forever, it should change to keep up with inflation. Alderman Wisbrock expressed if\n         target eliminated, it eliminates the range. Financial Consultant Tammy Alsop explained range adjustments\n         change minimum as well as maximum. Alderman Huels inquired how that would affect new hires if there\n         was no cap or adjustment to minimum, how would determination of pay for qualifications be calculated.\n\n         Mayor Maurath stated he feels the Maintenance Worker I, II, and III distinctions/classifications need to be\n        eliminated.\n\n        Mayor              Maurath                suggested                 further             discussion                 on       the        preliminary                   budget.              After          discussion,                  it    was\n                                                                                                                                                                            th\n        suggested                 to      continue               budget             hearing             on       Thursday,                 November                    16         before           the        Board            of Aldermen\n        meeting.\n\n        There were no public comments.\n\n        EXECUTIVE SESSION\n        There was no Executive Session held.\n\n        ADJOURNMENT\n        At 7:02 p.m., with no other business before the Board, Alderman Cruts made a motion to adjourn the\n        Budget Hearing.

Alderman Wisbrock inquired how that related to giving up a soccer field. Mayor Maurath stated it would not be available to Fenton residents as it would be utilized by outside groups and feels the expense does not benefit Fenton residents, who would pay for the lights. If lights are installed it encourages a constant barrage of play on the soccer fields. Is that what City wants to do with the City parks?\n\nAlderman Maserang shared the bid received was for approximately $330,000 not $500,000 and noted that currently the soccer fields are not utilized at night as they are not lit and dark. He feels lighted fields are in high demand and would not have problems renting them if they were lit. If the fields were not rented the lights would not be on. The people renting the fields would pay for the lights. Alderman Maserang shared the softball fields are lit and there are no problems with fields being rented with lighting.

Alderman Clauss asked if St. Paul's received a discount on that field. Public Works Director Dan Howard replied no - not the lit field.\n\nMayor Maurath stated he feels the soccer fields are not in good shape, there is no irrigation, and continuous play on them if they were lit would increase the wear on the fields. He feels the rental fee would not recoup the cost of installing lights, there has not been an analysis. Alderman Maserang shared typical seasonal use of soccer field for leagues is fall and they would not be utilized during growing season. Alderman Maserang stated if the only reason the City has parks is to make money, the parks should be closed as the City does not make money from parks, they are a service for the community.

Alderman Clauss asked if pay grades increased as cost of living and inflation increases each year. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner stated no, currently if employee reaches their maximum, they do not receive an increase. The Board would need to approve a pay grade increase. The last pay grade adjustment was made in 2018 through a CBIZ study. Financial Consultant Tammy Alsop shared CBIZ sends a recommendation each year for suggested increase to pay range, however, there has been no adjustments.\n\nMayor Maurath shared in relation to maxing out on pay grade, he feels caps should be eliminated. If the bar (target) keeps moving and being raised, why have it. Alderman Clauss voiced pay ranges cannot be kept at the same rate forever, it should change to keep up with inflation. Alderman Wisbrock expressed if the target eliminated, it eliminates the range. Financial Consultant Tammy Alsop explained range adjustments change minimum as well as maximum.
