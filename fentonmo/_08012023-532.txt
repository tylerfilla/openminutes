            CASE 2023-SUB-01: A Petition by US Capital Development on behalf of Fenton Land Investors for
            review of a Preliminary Plat to subdivide one existing Lot into seven Lots known at Fenton Logistics
            Park Plat Eight and containing 13.525 acres. The property is addressed as 750 Assembly Parkway
            and zoned "PID" Planned Industrial Development.

            Community       Development      Director   Amy    Starck   gave    a summary      of the   Staff   report to   the
            Commission. A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department.
            Director Starck explained that the plat was reviewed for compliance with the Subdivision Code and
            Amended Ordinance 4002 Master Zoning Ordinance for the development and was found to meet the
            requirements of both. She noted that the lots will be accessed via a private access and utility easement
            running through     the center of the     13.525-acre parcel    and evidence of a Maintenance Agreement,
            similar to others done within the development, will be required.

            The Petitioner, Scott Haley of US Capital Development, approached. He explained the proposed plat
            will subdivide    the final undeveloped      parcel located    in Area   A of the    planned   development.    The
            subdivision will create 7 new lots.

            The Commission asked about prospective businesses for the undeveloped lots. Mr. Haley explained
            that they have been meeting with prospective users and hope to have an anchor soon to complete the
            final 13 acres of development.

            Chairperson Yeoman read aloud the conditions of approval. The Petitioner agreed to all.

            Conditions of Approval:
                1.   This approval is for the subdivision of an existing parcel containing 13.526 acres into seven
                     (7) Lots, as shown on the plat submitted with the application and dated July 5, 2023.
                2.   An Access Maintenance Agreement shall be established for the private access easement and a
                     copy of the same provided to Community Development for City records.
                3.   The Petitioner shall provide two (2) copies of the approved Preliminary Plat to the Community
                     Development Director so that they may be signed by the Director. The plat shall state that the
                     approval is not final and that the Preliminary Plat is not to be recorded.
                4.   Compliance with all other applicable codes and ordinances of the City of Fenton.

                 CASE 2023-SP-02: A Petition by Scott Haley on behalf of Fenton Land Investors for a Sign Plan for
                 a proposed         Pole    Sign.     The     property       is addressed         as   750    Assembly         Parkway        and     zoned     "PID"
                Planned Industrial Development.

                Community            Development           Director       Amy       Starck      gave      a   summary         of    the    Staff     report     to   the
                Commission. A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department. She
                explained the Petitioner is proposing a pole sign or signs along North Highway Drive. The proposed
                50' height and 200 square-foot sign face                         exceed the maximum 35'                  height and        150 square-foot sign
                face allowed when signs are proposed along Interstate frontage. Additionally, the Site Plan appears to
                indicate either one (1) proposed Pole Sign at the location labeled Option A, or two (2) Pole Signs, one
                at each of the locations labeled Option B.

                The Petitioner, Scott Haley from                     US    Capital Development, approached.                       He clarified that only one
                Pole Sign is proposed, and the location would be either Option A, or one of the two locations provided
                as Options        B on the Site Plan. He explained the purpose of the proposed Pole Sign was to showcase
                the    area    as the     sign    would      include      spaces     for    all seven      future     tenants      on the      seven     future     lots.
                Additionally,         it would aid        in showing potential              users that signage along North Highway Drive to
                identify their business had been approved by the City. Mr. Haley added that the sign would not be
                erected before the buildings were built.

                The Commission discussed concerns with approving a Sign Plan for undeveloped property and future
                signage that may be requested for the development along North Highway Drive. Director Starck stated
                that any future          signage that would              not meet the         requirements          of the     Sign Code would              require     a
                separate Sign Plan that would be brought to the Commission for review and consideration. Mayor
                Maurath noted that the City has approved similar signs for other developments in the City (Gravois
                Bluffs, Dierbergs Fenton Crossing, and Fenton Plaza).

                Following discussion Chairperson Yeoman suggested amending the conditions of approval to clarify
                the locations of the proposed Pole Sign and                          that the request is for a single sign at only the location
                indicated in Option A, or only one of the two locations in Option B on the Site Plan.

                Chairperson Yeoman read aloud the amended conditions of approval. The Petitioner agreed to all.

                                      identified in either Option A or Option B,                                                as    indicated on the Site Plan submitted with the

                              2.      Any proposed future Signs for the subject Lots that are not in compliance with the Sign Code
                                      shall       require          a    separate           Sign       Plan       review.          Nothing             in    this      requirement               shall       prevent the
                                      installation of new Signs in compliance with the Sign Code, via applicable permits.
                              3.      Municipal Zoning Approval by the                                            City of Fenton and                        a Sign Permit issued by                              St.    Louis
                                      County will be required for the proposed signs.
                              4.      Compliance with all other applicable City Codes and Ordinances.


                      Following               discussion               Chairperson                   Yeoman               made           a    motion            to     APPROVE,                    with         amended
                      conditions, CASE 2023-SP-02. Commissioner Voorhees seconded the motion.

                      CASE 2023-SUP-11: A Petition by Corbin Holtzman on behalf of Talaria MO, LLC for a Special
                     Use Permit to operate a Marijuana Transportation Facility at 2275 Cassens Drive, Suite 130. The
                      parcel is addressed as 143 Cassens Court and is zoned "IP-1" Industrial Park District.

                     Community                   Development                   Director            Amy          Starck          gave         a     summary               of the           Staff       report          to     the
                     Commission. A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department. She
                     explained that the proposed Marijuana Transportation Facility is not within 1,000 feet of any Church,
                     School, or Daycare Facility, as required, but that additional information about the proposed operation,
                     including security measures and odor control, and visibility of the product from outside the facility by
                     the public were not provided with the application.

                     The Petitioners, Corbin Holtzman and Doug Holtzman, owners of the property and speaking on behalf
                     of the tenant, Talaria MO, LLC, appeared via Zoom. Corbin Holtzman explained the proposed tenant
                     will discretely operate strictly to transport marijuana product, packaging, money, and other products
                     within          the      cannabis            industry,            with       additional             lab      testing         consisting             of small             samples,            but      that
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                rd
                     transportation is their main function. He added that Marijuana Businesses are required to have a 3
                     party to take product from point A to point B which is what would be provided by the tenant. He also
                     added that the tenant has a board of security advisors and there will be security cameras and access
                     control to the facility. He also offered that there would be a I0'Xl5' room containing an 8'xl0' safe
                     should any product need to be stored overnight, but the goal is to not store it at the facility.

                 When asked about how much product might be brought in or stored on site at any given time, he
                 stated none because they do not intend to bring product back to the facility. Petitioner Doug Holtzman
                 stated that legally, product cannot come through the facility. When asked to clarify how testing would
                 be performed and             the   need     for   8xl O safe       if no    product could          come through the             facility,   Corbin
                 answered that minimal quantities, no more than a briefcase worth, would be anticipated. Petitioner
                 Doug Holtzman offered that the 10xl5 room would be used to store product on an emergency basis
                 with    an   area to     perform       some testing.         No details were provided about the                      area for testing.           The
                 Commission also questioned the Petitioner about the traffic the tenant would create and what type of
                 vehicles would be used. Corbin answered that it would create minimal traffic and deliveries would be
                 by a cargo van that would blend in with other traffic and be discreet.

                 The     Commission           asked      the    Petitioners       additional       questions       regarding        security      measures        and
                procedures, odor control, and general operations of the business. Doug Holtzman queried why this
                 information        was     needed      as   it would       be   primarily       a   back    office     logistic    operation       serving      as   a
                call/dispatch center and that those sorts of requirements are regulated by the State. He further stated
                that they have specs of the building for construction and are comfortable speaking on behalf of the
                tenant as the property owner. City Attorney, Erin Seele made clear that, as the City's code is written,
                State     requirements         are   also    Fenton's       requirements,         and    other    Marijuana        facilities     have    provided
                details     about     safety,     security,     filters    for   odor    control,      and    other    operational        information        for   the
                Commission's peace of mind adding that the information is needed to make the required findings and
                understand         the    proposed        use.    Additionally,         Chairperson         Yeoman         explained        the    standards       the
                Commission uses             to   review a       SUP,     and as      this   is not an      allowed      Use that is        permitted      by   right,
                sufficient information has not been provided to meet that obligation.

                Following         discussion,        Mayor       Maurath        suggested        continuing        as    the    Commission           needs      more
                information and discussion with tenant.

                Chairperson Yeoman made a motion to CONTINUE CASE 2023-SUP-11. Commissioner Glover
                seconded the motion.
