A copy of the PowerPoint presentation is attached for the record and\n            copies of corresponding     documents    provided to   the Commission     are on file with   the Community\n            Development Department.\n\n            Director Starck explained that the format of the Comprehensive Plan is proposed away from the \"road\n            map\"   version of the    1997 Comprehensive      Plan to an   easier booklet   format. She   summarized    the\n            Introduction section of the   proposed   Comprehensive    Plan that is divided   into an Overview, detailing\n            relevant history and demographics of the City, and Purpose, providing overall objectives of the Plan to act\n            as a guide for future development/redevelopment. The Plan is divided into six Planning Areas. Director\n            Starck emphasized that special attention was paid to retaining the overall intent and directives of the 1997\n            Comprehensive Plan.\n\n            Director Starck   briefly summarized     the six   planning areas;   Public and   Governmental;    Parks and\n            Recreation; Residential;   Olde Towne;    Commercial;    and Business   and Industrial. Each   Planning Area\n            provides an Overview, Goals, and Objectives and any notable changes from the 1997 Plan are detailed in\n            the footnotes. She mentioned that, at the direction of the Commission, the Plan identifies large lots within\n            the Residential   Planning Area    as those   with a   minimum    of one   acre in   keeping with   the 1997\n            Comprehensive Plan. She further remarked that, based on multiple discussions during the workshops, the\n            Commission sought to clarify The Plan and added language to include specifically prohibiting residential\n            uses/developments    in the Commercial    Planning area as   they did not   feel it was in keeping   with the\n            character and nature of the Planning Area. Based on the proposed changes, Director Starck commented\n            that Staff will be bringing needed Zoning Code amendments and rezoning requests to the Commission\n            throughout the year.\n\n            Following the presentation, there were no comments from the public or the Commission. Director Starck\n            stated that a resolution to adopt the changes to The Plan would be considered at the December 5, 2023\n            Planning and Zoning Commission meeting to follow the Public Hearing at 7:00 PM.\n\n   ADJOURNMENT:           6:26 p.m.\n\n            A motion to adjourn was made by Commissioner Nelson and seconded by Alderman Harrell. The motion\n            was unanimously approved by voice vote.\n\n            Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n                                                                            /    ///     u!__\n                                                                           ~~\n                                                                       Callan Yeomif, Chairperson\n                     ity Development Director                          Planning and Zoning Commission\n\f\nDecember 3, 2023\n\nCallan Yeoman\nChairperson\n1321 Montevale Ct\nFenton, MO 63026\n\nTo the City of Fenton Planning and Zoning Commission:\n\nI regret that I cannot be there tonight for the approval of the Comprehensive Development Plan. The\nupdates to the plan represent an important moment for the City, and I am very grateful to my fellow\nCommissioners for the thoughtful discussion and debate that contributed to the final updates.\nThroughout the workshops, I was impressed with the thorough consideration given to each planning\narea, and the Commission's willingness to engage in discussion for the betterment of our City. I fully\nsupport the final plan, and I apologize for missing the vote and public hearing. I had a family conflict that\nkept me from joining you. I also want to thank Amy, Erin and the rest of the City staff that worked on the\nupdates.

A copy of the letter is attached to the minutes for the record.\n\nOLD BUSINESS: None\n\nNEW BUSINESS:\n\nPlanning and Zoning Commission Workshop Page 2 December 5, 2023\n\nPUBLIC HEARING FOR CASE 2023-CPD-01: Consideration of amendments to the City of Fenton Comprehensive Development Plan.\n\nCommunity Development Director Amy Starck gave a presentation summarizing the proposed changes to the Comprehensive Plan (The Plan) and provided a draft of the proposed changes based on workshop discussions held over the past year. A copy of the PowerPoint presentation is attached for the record and copies of corresponding documents provided to the Commission are on file with the Community Development Department.\n\nDirector Starck explained that the format of the Comprehensive Plan is proposed away from the \"road map\" version of the 1997 Comprehensive Plan to an easier booklet format. She summarized the Introduction section of the proposed Comprehensive Plan that is divided into an Overview, detailing relevant history and demographics of the City, and Purpose, providing overall objectives of the Plan to act as a guide for future development/redevelopment. The Plan is divided into six Planning Areas. Director Starck emphasized that special attention was paid to retaining the overall intent and directives of the 1997 Comprehensive Plan.\n\nDirector Starck briefly summarized the six planning areas; Public and Governmental; Parks and Recreation; Residential; Olde Towne; Commercial; and Business and Industrial. Each Planning Area provides an Overview, Goals, and Objectives and any notable changes from the 1997 Plan are detailed in the footnotes. She mentioned that, at the direction of the Commission, the Plan identifies large lots within the Residential Planning Area as those with a minimum of one acre in keeping with the 1997 Comprehensive Plan. She further remarked that, based on multiple discussions during the workshops, the Commission sought to clarify The Plan and added language to include specifically prohibiting residential uses/developments in the Commercial Planning area as they did not feel it was in keeping with the character and nature of the Planning Area. Based on the proposed changes, Director Starck commented that Staff will be bringing needed Zoning Code amendments and rezoning requests to the Commission throughout the year.\n\nFollowing the presentation, there were no comments from the public or the Commission. Director Starck stated that a resolution to adopt the changes to The Plan would be considered at the December 5, 2023 Planning and Zoning Commission meeting to follow the Public Hearing at 7:00 PM.\n\nADJOURNMENT: 6:26 p.m.\n\nA motion to adjourn was made by Commissioner Nelson and seconded by Alderman Harrell. The motion was unanimously approved by voice vote.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nCallan Yeoman, Chairperson\nPlanning and Zoning Commission\n\nDecember 3, 2023\n\nCallan Yeoman Chairperson 1321 Montevale Ct Fenton, MO 63026\n\nTo the City of Fenton Planning and Zoning Commission:\n\nI regret that I cannot be there tonight for the approval of the Comprehensive Development Plan. The updates to the plan represent an important moment for the City, and I am very grateful to my fellow Commissioners for the thoughtful discussion and debate that contributed to the final updates. Throughout the workshops, I was impressed with the thorough consideration given to each planning area, and the Commission's willingness to engage in discussion for the betterment of our City. I fully support the final plan, and I apologize for missing the vote and public hearing. I had a family conflict that kept me from joining you. I also want to thank Amy, Erin and the rest of the City staff that worked on the updates. Their guidance and support make our jobs as Commissioners much easier, and their work on the plan was much greater than ours. Thank you for allowing me to be excused tonight, and I look forward to seeing you next month.\n\nSincerely,\n\nCallan Yeoman Chairperson Fenton Planning and Zoning Commission"}]
