This    Special Use          Permit approval           is solely     for   Talaria     MO,      LLC      to operate a        Marijuana\n                  Transportation Facility at 2275 Cassens Drive, Suite 130,                                  in accordance with Chapter 430,\n                  Article IX of the Zoning Code. Said use does not include laboratory testing or certifying of\n                  Marijuana.\n\n            2.    Proof of State Licensing, as                 required under Section 430.680 of the Zoning Code, must be\n                  provided to the Community Development Director before an Occupancy Permit is issued for\n                  the subject location.\n\n            3.

At the September meeting, it was confirmed by the applicant\n            that this facility will not be a testing facility, will not have a lab, and is not a storage facility, but\n            product may be temporarily held on-site within a secure room when deliveries cannot be made\n            within a workday, but state requirements do not allow product to held for more than 72 hours.\n\n            Petitioner Michelle Morris was in attendance of the meeting via Zoom Videoconference and had\n            nothing further to add.\n\n\u2022     Approval, with conditions, of CASE 2023-SUP-12: A Petition by Abier Mseitef of S&H Spirit, Inc.\n      d/b/a Fenton Liquor and Tobacco for a Special Use Permit to operate a Liquor Store and Tobacco Shop\n      at 645 Gravois Road.

Compliance with all other applicable City Codes and Ordinances.\n\n      Alderman Harrell explained that a SUP was approved in April for Stars Liquor and Tobacco; however,\n      the Petitioner recently established a new corporate entity and business name. Additionally, the Board\n      approved a text amendment in May to add Tobacco Shops to the Code as a Use that now requires a SUP\n      in \"OT-2\". Since            SUPs      are non-transferrable,            and a     SUP is       now needed for            Tobacco        Shops, the\n      Petitioner is seeking a new SUP. No changes to the operation of the business are proposed.\n\n      City Attorney Erin Seele noted there was a typo in conditions of approval, and it will also include\n     operating as a Tobacco Shop.\n\n\u2022    Approval, with conditions, of CASE 2023-SUP-13: A Petition by Land R Group Corp. for a Special\n     Use Permit to operate an Indoor Limited Recreational Facility at 2045 Ritzert Court.
