Cruts, Chairman (Wisbrock, Huels, Jokerst)\n\u2022    February 28, 2023, Monthly Financial Report (Draft).\n     Alderman Cruts summarized the draft monthly financial report.\n\n\u2022    2022 Amended Budget.\n     A summary of the proposed budget amendments, with details by fund to close out fiscal year 2022 were\n     available for review. Alderman Cruts summarized the amendments. There were no further comments or\n     questions.\n\n     Alderman Cruts made a motion to forward to the April Board of Aldermen meeting the 2022 amended\n     budget. The motion was seconded by Alderman Jokerst. Upon a vote being taken, the motion passed\n     unanimously by the Committee.\n\n\u2022    Consideration of a Supplemental Cooperation Agreement with St. Louis County, Missouri for the\n     allocation of Community Block Grant Funds for the year 2022.\n     A copy of the Municipal Housing and Community Development Supplemental Cooperation Agreement\n     for the 2022 Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) which needs to be considered for approval\n     by the Board was available for review. Execution of the agreement is required to receive the requested\n     funds.\n\n     Alderman Cruts made a motion to forward to the April Board of Aldermen meeting the consideration of\n     a   Supplemental         Cooperation        Agreement         with    St.   Louis     County,      Missouri       for   the   allocation      of\n     Community Block Grant Funds for the year 2022. The motion was seconded by Alderman Huels. Upon\n     a vote being taken, the motion passed unanimously by the Committee.\n\n\u2022    Request to continue utilizing Amazon Business Prime.\n     In February of 2020, the Board approved a request by Staff to create an Amazon Business account for\n     the City under a Government Account, which limits the number of users on the account (who can use\n     the account), controls what can be purchased, provides a cost savings on co-op purchases, and allows\n     the City to make tax-exempt purchases under the Amazon Tax Exempt Program (ATEP).\n\n     On May 27, 2021, the Board approved the City upgrading the account to a Prime membership for $179\n     per year but requested that this matter be brought back in a year to decipher if the annual fee is cost\n     effective. On April 28, 2022, the Board approved renewing the Prime account at $179 per year.\n\n     It is noted that Amazon Business is frequently used by Staff to purchase supplies online, and the Prime\n     membership provides an efficient way to make purchases with our tax-exempt status and allows the\n     account administrators and the Finance Department to track purchases and invoices. Additionally, the\n     online ordering does            not require       Staff leaving the offices             to   make the       purchases       and   the   Prime\n     membership does not require a minimum purchase and typically has one (1) and two (2) day deliveries.\n\n     Based on the above, Staff is requesting that the Board consider allowing the City to renew the Prime\n     membership for the annual cost of $179, and further requests that Staff be able to continue to renew\n     annually without Board approval, unless the membership cost increases.\n\n     Alderman Cruts made a motion to forward to the April Board of Aldermen meeting request to renew the\n     Prime membership for the annual cost of $179, and Staff be able to continue to renew annually without\n     Board      approval,      unless    the   membership          cost   increases.      The    motion      was    seconded       by   Alderman\n     Wisbrock. Upon a vote being taken, the motion passed unanimously by the Committee.\n\n     Mayor Maurath noted he prefers to try to buy local as much as possible.\n\n\n                                                                          2\n                                                      Board of Aldermen Committee Meeting\n                                                                   April 13, 2023\n\f\n\u2022    Presentation and request by Infinity Hospitality, LLC for a CID, TDD, and Tax Abatement for\n     the redevelopment of a property located at 800 S. Highway Drive.\n     A redevelopment proposal was available for review and attached as part of the minutes.\n\n     Vinod      Patel,   800    South Highway Drive,               Fenton MO 63026, Infinity                  Hospitality,      LLC shared the\n     property has been vacant for approximately four to five ( 4-5) years and noted there are a lot of issues\n     with the property. They have had a couple potential buyers but were not able to make the sale work\n     because of zoning. They would be hands on and are proposing an upgrade with dual brand name hotel\n     by Marriott with upscaled restaurant, sport/social venue, and possible freestanding retail strip center\n     with end cap. The project would cost $40-50 million dollars. He expressed the project would generate\n     taxes and revenue for the City and County. He shared the only way to make it work is with help from\n     the City and County through CID, TDD, and tax abatement incentives estimated at $4-5 million dollars\n     and create 150-250 jobs.\n\n     Mayor Maurath asked for clarification on why the difference in the proposal between the estimated\n     development cost totaling $44.8 million dollars while the summary cost totals were $38.8 million.\n     Vinod replied possible glitch in numbers.\n\n     Alderman Jokerst inquired on proposal tearing down only part of the structure, she believes the entire\n     structure is not safe. Vinod replied due to 20' easement to make the project work with conception cost\n     and increase in interest rate.\n\n     Hema! Patel explained difference in development cost vs summary cost is construction cost built in\n     outside the soft costs engineering.\n\n     Mayor Maurath inquired if the $44.8 million dollar project is asking City to participate in the $3.5\n     million dollar acquisition cost also. Hema! replied no, acquisition cost is listed for owner invested\n     equity. Mayor Maurath inquired if they were aware that the                                previous owner of this property has a\n     lawsuit pending with the City Administrator and according to those records the sale price was                                               $2.5\n     million not $3 .5 million dollars. Vinod stated they had to buy out their partner and now they are the sole\n     owner of the property. Mayor Maurath inquired if they are asking the citizens of Fenton to subsidize\n     their buyout. Vinod responded no; this is the construction cost. Mayor Maurath expressed he feels the\n     costs do not make sense and there are too many deficiencies in the proposal. Hema) stated they can\n     revise the proposal to show the appropriate numbers.\n\n     Alderman Bereitschaft expressed confusion on project proposal and whether it is a partial tear down or\n     a complete tear down. Hema! shared they would try to utilize the main building structure in front with\n    only part of it being tom down and the back to buildings would be partially tom down as well to utilize\n     the building foundation.\n\n     Alderman Clauss stated she did not want to lead them on for consideration of the request as she does\n     not have much interest in the project and feels they are asking City to subsidize the project when there\n    are other businesses in the City that have not received incentives from the City. Alderman Cruts echoed\n     Alderman Clauss' comment and stated if the project would move forward, he feels the whole structure\n     needs to be torn down and if not assurance would be needed for safety concerns. Vinod shared they did\n     not want to use old building but with easement running through the middle of current building, a new\n     building cannot be built on the easement. Mayor Maurath asked if they were aware of the easement and\n    that may have been a factor of the sale price. Vinod replied yes and further shared that before Covid the\n    other partner wanted a different hotel brand, but they were not interested in that.\n\n    Mayor Maurath reiterated he feels                    if the City gives out the tax incentive there is                      no   benefit to the\n    citizens of Fenton. Vinod stated they are not asking the City to fund the whole project cost of $44.8\n    million dollars, only a portion approximately $4 million dollars. Hema) stated the ask is not to take\n\n                                                                          3\n                                                      Board of Aldermen Committee Meeting\n                                                                   April 13, 2023\n\f\n      away from what the City is currently receiving but rather to subsidize part of the increase the City will\n      receive when the project is completed.\n\n      Alderman Jokerst expressed she feels they were aware of easement when purchased and asked what\n      incentive they are requesting from City. Vinod stated TDD would be through County and Court, CID\n      for   1% tax on room rate and up to $5                    on special easement assistance and tax abatement would be\n      Fenton. Hemal stated it is hard to compete with properties across the highway that have a TIF, he feels\n      their TIF      throws     the   property tax and           does    increase other development.                The    development of the\n      property      would     increase      the   tax.   Mayor      Maurath       stated    the    City    turned     down     the    TIF   for   that\n      development when requested.\n\n      Alderman Huels echoed Board comments and she feels it would set a precedence and has not been\n      offered to any other business in Fenton. She further expressed she believes they were aware of the\n      easement when purchased and that it not the responsibility of the residents to fund the project.\n\n      Hemal stated he anticipates the property tax would increase by $100,000 ($50,000 now and increase to\n      $150,000) if improved and would only ask for a temporary abatement. Mayor Maurath stated the City\n      does not have a property tax. Hema) stated needed to present to City before presenting a request to the\n      County.\n\n     Alderman Jokerst inquired why previous developments presentations were not followed through. Hema!\n      stated the building and property has many challenges, the hotel brands they deal with were not willing\n     to come here for a two (2) story building, hospitality industry declined due to Covid, and denial of\n     zoning changes.\n\n     Mayor Maurath stated City has laws and Codes in place to address the current condition of property, the\n     City is requesting the property to be cleaned up and brought up to Code and further shared the City has\n     not offered incentives to any prior requests.\n\n     Alderman Cruts made a motion to forward to the April Board of Aldermen meeting the denial of\n     request by Infinity Hospitality, LLC for a CID, TDD, and Tax Abatement for the redevelopment of a\n     property located at 800 S. Highway Drive. The motion was seconded by Alderman Jokerst. Upon a vote\n     being taken, the motion passed unanimously by the Committee.\n\n     Hemal inquired if he could present to St. Louis County. Mayor Maurath stated City has no control over\n     St. Louis County. City Attorney Erin Seele shared typically County requires letter of approval from the\n     City, however that request was not on this agenda for consideration.\n\n\u2022    Request for the Mayor to execute and understanding of services letter in conjunction with the City's\n     Auditing Services.\n     On October 28, 2021, via Ordinance 4173, the City of Fenton approved an agreement with Botz, Deal\n     & Company P.C. for auditing services for the fiscal years 2021, 2022, and 2023. A letter regarding the\n     understanding of services for the fiscal year 2022 from Botz, Deal & Company, P.C. that needs to be\n     executed      by   the City      in conjunction with           the City's Auditing          Service Agreement was                available for\n     review. At this time, it is requested that the Board approve the Mayor executing the understanding of\n     services letter.\n\n     After discussion, Alderman Cruts made a motion to open the topic to the full Board. The motion was\n     seconded       by   Alderman        Huels.     Upon a       vote    being taken,        the   motion      passed     unanimously         by the\n     Committee.\n\n     Alderman Cruts made a final motion to approve the request for the Mayor to execute and understanding\n     of services letter in conjunction with the City's Auditing Services. The motion was seconded by Alderman\n     Wisbrock.

Medicare is also accepted with Medicare card and driver's license. There will be no cost to the\n         City for this event.\n\n         After discussion, Alderman Jokerst made a motion to forward to the April Board of Aldermen meeting\n         the request to have the annual flu shot clinic at RiverChase YMCA. The motion was seconded by\n         Alderman Clauss. Upon a vote being taken, the motion passed unanimously by the Committee.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS\n\u2022        Consideration of a request by St. Paul Catholic Church for a Temporary Liquor License.\n         St. Paul Catholic Church is requesting a temporary liquor license for a picnic to be held at the church\n                                                                                                                                                  th                                                                                            th\n         grounds located at 15 Forest Knoll Drive on Friday, May 26                                                                                   from 5 - 10 p.m. and Saturday, May 27\n         from l O a.m. - 10 p.m. The applicant has submitted all needed documents to process the liquor license\n         and meets the qualifications of Section 600.055.\n\n         Alderman Cruts made a motion to forward to the April Board of Aldermen meeting the request by St.\n         Paul         Catholic              Church              for      a     Temporary                   Liquor            License              The        motion             was         seconded                by      Alderman\n         Bereitschaft. Upon a vote being taken, the motion passed unanimously by the Board of Aldermen.\n\n\u2022        Request to purchase an RC Slope Mower.\n         On March 16th, Staff along with the Mayor had an opportunity to demo a Radio Controlled (RC) Slope\n         Mower on the Presslar Lake dam in the Fabick Nature Preserve. An RC Slope Mower is a remote-\n         controlled mower that is capable of mowing up to fifty-degree (50\u00b0) slopes and is capable of cutting up\n         to one- and one-half inch (1                                     1/2\") diameter growth. The mower is powered by a gas engine, operates on\n         a track system instead of tires/wheels, and is controlled by one (I) operator utilizing a remote-control\n         unit with a range of up to one thousand feet (1,000'). The unit demonstrated had a fifty-two-inch (52\")\n         cutting width with a twenty-seven and a half (27 .5) HP engine. Pictures of the mower and the area that\n         was cut during the demonstration were available for review. As indicated in the dam photo, half ( 1/2) of\n        the dam was cut and accomplished within twenty (20) minutes with one (1) operator.\n\n        The City is responsible for maintaining three (3) dams within in our parks system at least once a year to\n         keep the               vegetation cut and                             \"woody\"                growth             from         establishing                  on the            dams. Currently,                          the      City\n        performs this maintenance utilizing three to four (3-4) employees with weed eaters (line trimmer heads\n        and at least one (1) with a metal cutting head for the \"woody\" material). Staff has attempted to utilize\n        other equipment with no success due to the extreme slope of the dams.\n\n                                                                                                                        7\n                                                                                         Board ofAldermen Committee Meeting\n                                                                                                             April 13, 2023\n\f\n      Our current operation utilizing weed trimmers only allows for one (1) dam to be cut per day (utilizing\n      three     to   four    (3-4)     employees).         During      this    operation,       the    employees        are    placed      in   extreme\n      circumstances due to the slope of dams. These areas are very difficult to simply walk on, or in the\n      circumstance, walk and operate equipment. The City, on multiple occasions, had to send employees to\n      urgent care due to bee stings (apparently bees like the conditions), twisted/sprained ankles, and injured\n      backs. Additionally, equipment has been damaged due to the conditions, at no fault of the employees.\n\n      At this time, Staff is requesting to purchase an RC Slope Mower to add to our fleet. If approved, the\n      mower would not only be utilized to maintain the dams, more than once a year, but will be used in other\n      areas that have been requested to be maintained. These include areas along the Meramec riverbank\n      where the brush hog cannot get into and the new flail mower cannot reach, areas in the Olde Towne\n      Park and Fabick Nature Preserve, and newly cleared areas of honeysuckle to minimize the regrowth.\n\n      The cost of a new fifty-two-inch (52\") RC Slope Mower is $65,450 with options; however, a couple of\n      used/low hour machines with a one-year warranty priced in the mid $40,000 are also available. If\n      approved, this purchase would need to be added to the 2023 Capital Plan and would be paid for through\n      Parks and Stormwater funds.\n\n      After discussion, Alderman Cruts made a motion to forward to the April Board of Aldermen meeting\n      the request to purchase a new TK-52XP RC Slope Mower. The motion was seconded by Alderman\n      Clauss. Upon a vote being taken, the motion passed unanimously by the Board of Aldermen.\n\nEXECUTIVE SESSION\nAt 8:06 p.m. Alderman Clauss made a motion to enter into Executive Session pursuant to Section 610.021:\n(1) Legal actions, causes of action or litigation, (2) Leasing, purchase, or sale of real estate, and (13)\nIndividually identifiable personnel records, performance ratings or records pertaining to employees and or\napplicants for employment. The motion was seconded by Alderman Huels.\n\nUpon the roll being called, the Board of Aldermen voted as follows:\n\n                       Alderman Cruts                    Aye                      Alderman Clauss                    Aye\n                       Alderman Bereitschaft Aye                                  Alderman Huels                     Aye\n                       Alderman Wisbrock                 Aye                      Alderman Maserang                  Aye\n                       Alderman Harrell                  Aye                      Alderman Jokerst                  Aye\n\nIt was announced that the motion was passed by the Board ofAldermen.\n\nADJOURNMENT\nAt 9:01     p.m. Mayor Maurath reconvened the meeting, with no other business before the Board, Alderman\nCruts made a motion to adjourn.

On April 28, 2022, the Board approved renewing the Prime account at $179 per year.\n\nIt is noted that Amazon Business is frequently used by Staff to purchase supplies online, and the Prime membership provides an efficient way to make purchases with our tax-exempt status and allows the account administrators and the Finance Department to track purchases and invoices. Additionally, the online ordering does not require Staff leaving the offices to make the purchases and the Prime membership does not require a minimum purchase and typically has one (1) and two (2) day deliveries.\n\nBased on the above, Staff is requesting that the Board consider allowing the City to renew the Prime membership for the annual cost of $179, and further requests that Staff be able to continue to renew annually without Board approval, unless the membership cost increases.\n\nAlderman Cruts made a motion to forward to the April Board of Aldermen meeting request to renew the Prime membership for the annual cost of $179, and Staff be able to continue to renew annually without Board approval, unless the membership cost increases. The motion was seconded by Alderman Wisbrock. Upon a vote being taken, the motion passed unanimously by the Committee.\n\nMayor Maurath noted he prefers to try to buy local as much as possible.\n\n- Presentation and request by Infinity Hospitality, LLC for a CID, TDD, and Tax Abatement for the redevelopment of a property located at 800 S. Highway Drive.\nA redevelopment proposal was available for review and attached as part of the minutes.\n\nVinod Patel, 800 South Highway Drive, Fenton MO 63026, Infinity Hospitality, LLC shared the property has been vacant for approximately four to five (4-5) years and noted there are a lot of issues with the property. They have had a couple of potential buyers but were not able to make the sale work because of zoning. They would be hands-on and are proposing an upgrade with a dual brand name hotel by Marriott with an upscaled restaurant, sports/social venue, and possible freestanding retail strip center with end cap. The project would cost $40-50 million dollars. He expressed the project would generate taxes and revenue for the City and County. He shared the only way to make it work is with help from the City and County through CID, TDD, and tax abatement incentives estimated at $4-5 million dollars and create 150-250 jobs.\n\nMayor Maurath asked for clarification on why the difference in the proposal between the estimated development cost totaling $44.8 million dollars while the summary cost totals were $38.8 million. Vinod replied possible glitch in numbers.\n\nAlderman Jokerst inquired about the proposal tearing down only part of the structure, she believes the entire structure is not safe. Vinod replied due to 20' easement to make the project work with conception cost and increase in interest rate.\n\nHemal Patel explained difference in development cost vs summary cost is construction cost built outside the soft costs engineering.\n\nMayor Maurath inquired if the $44.8 million dollar project is asking the City to participate in the $3.5 million dollar acquisition cost also. Hemal replied no, acquisition cost is listed for owner invested equity. Mayor Maurath inquired if they were aware that the previous owner of this property has a lawsuit pending with the City Administrator and according to those records the sale price was $2.5 million not $3.5 million dollars. Vinod stated they had to buy out their partner and now they are the sole owner of the property. Mayor Maurath inquired if they are asking the citizens of Fenton to subsidize their buyout. Vinod responded no; this is the construction cost. Mayor Maurath expressed he feels the costs do not make sense and there are too many deficiencies in the proposal. Hemal stated they can revise the proposal to show the appropriate numbers.\n\nAlderman Bereitschaft expressed confusion on project proposal and whether it is a partial tear down or a complete tear down. Hemal shared they would try to utilize the main building structure in front with only part of it being torn down and the back two buildings would be partially torn down as well to utilize the building foundation.\n\nAlderman Clauss stated she did not want to lead them on for consideration of the request as she does not have much interest in the project and feels they are asking City to subsidize the project when there are other businesses in the City that have not received incentives from the City. Alderman Cruts echoed Alderman Clauss' comment and stated if the project would move forward, he feels the whole structure needs to be torn down and if not assurance would be needed for safety concerns. Vinod shared they did not want to use the old building but with easement running through the middle of the current building, a new building cannot be built on the easement. Mayor Maurath asked if they were aware of the easement and that may have been a factor of the sale price. Vinod replied yes and further shared that before Covid the other partner wanted a different hotel brand, but they were not interested in that.\n\nMayor Maurath reiterated he feels if the City gives out the tax incentive there is no benefit to the citizens of Fenton. Vinod stated they are not asking the City to fund the whole project cost of $44.8 million dollars, only a portion approximately $4 million dollars. Hemal stated the ask is not to take away from what the City is currently receiving but rather to subsidize part of the increase the City will receive when the project is completed.\n\nAlderman Jokerst expressed she feels they were aware of easement when purchased and asked what incentive they are requesting from City. Vinod stated TDD would be through County and Court, CID for 1% tax on room rate and up to $5 on special easement assistance and tax abatement would be Fenton. Hemal stated it is hard to compete with properties across the highway that have a TIF, he feels their TIF throws the property tax and does increase other development. The development of the property would increase the tax. Mayor Maurath stated the City turned down the TIF for that development when requested.\n\nAlderman Huels echoed Board comments and she feels it would set a precedence and has not been offered to any other business in Fenton. She further expressed she believes they were aware of the easement when purchased and that it not the responsibility of the residents to fund the project.\n\nHemal stated he anticipates the property tax would increase by $100,000 ($50,000 now and increase to $150,000) if improved and would only ask for a temporary abatement. Mayor Maurath stated the City does not have a property tax. Hemal stated needed to present to City before presenting a request to the County.\n\nAlderman Jokerst inquired why previous developments presentations were not followed through. Hemal stated the building and property has many challenges, the hotel brands they deal with were not willing to come here for a two (2) story building, hospitality industry declined due to Covid, and denial of zoning changes.\n\nMayor Maurath stated City has laws and Codes in place to address the current condition of property, the City is requesting the property to be cleaned up and brought up to Code and further shared the City has not offered incentives to any prior requests.\n\nAlderman Cruts made a motion to forward to the April Board of Aldermen meeting the denial of request by Infinity Hospitality, LLC for a CID, TDD, and Tax Abatement for the redevelopment of a property located at 800 S. Highway Drive. The motion was seconded by Alderman Jokerst. Upon a vote being taken, the motion passed unanimously by the Committee.\n\nHemal inquired if he could present to St. Louis County. Mayor Maurath stated City has no control over St. Louis County. City Attorney Erin Seele shared typically County requires letter of approval from the City, however that request was not on this agenda for consideration.\n\n- Request for the Mayor to execute an understanding of services letter in conjunction with the City's Auditing Services.\nOn October 28, 2021, via Ordinance 4173, the City of Fenton approved an agreement with Botz, Deal & Company P.C. for auditing services for the fiscal years 2021, 2022, and 2023. A letter regarding the understanding of services for the fiscal year 2022 from Botz, Deal & Company, P.C. that needs to be executed by the City in conjunction with the City's Auditing Service Agreement was available for review. At this time, it is requested that the Board approve the Mayor executing the understanding of services letter.\n\nAfter discussion, Alderman Cruts made a motion to open the topic to the full Board. The motion was seconded by Alderman Huels. Upon a vote being taken, the motion passed unanimously by the Committee.\n\nAlderman Cruts made a final motion to approve the request for the Mayor to execute an understanding of services letter in conjunction with the City's Auditing Services. The motion was seconded by Alderman Wisbrock. Upon a vote being taken, the motion passed unanimously by the Board of Aldermen.\n\nPLANNING AND ZONING COMMISSION REPORT -Aid.

Upon a vote being taken, the motion passed unanimously by the Board of Aldermen.\n\n- Request to purchase an RC Slope Mower.\nOn March 16th, Staff along with the Mayor had an opportunity to demo a Radio Controlled (RC) Slope Mower on the Presslar Lake dam in the Fabick Nature Preserve. An RC Slope Mower is a remote-controlled mower that is capable of mowing up to fifty-degree (50\u00b0) slopes and is capable of cutting up to one-and-one-half inch (1 1/2\") diameter growth. The mower is powered by a gas engine, operates on a track system instead of tires/wheels, and is controlled by one (1) operator utilizing a remote-control unit with a range of up to one thousand feet (1,000'). The unit demonstrated had a fifty-two-inch (52\") cutting width with a twenty-seven and a half (27.5) HP engine. Pictures of the mower and the area that was cut during the demonstration were available for review. As indicated in the dam photo, half (1/2) of the dam was cut and accomplished within twenty (20) minutes with one (1) operator.\n\nThe City is responsible for maintaining three (3) dams within our parks system at least once a year to keep the vegetation cut and \"woody\" growth from establishing on the dams. Currently, the City performs this maintenance utilizing three to four (3-4) employees with weed eaters (line trimmer heads and at least one (1) with a metal cutting head for the \"woody\" material). Staff has attempted to utilize other equipment with no success due to the extreme slope of the dams.\n\nOur current operation utilizing weed trimmers only allows for one (1) dam to be cut per day (utilizing three to four (3-4) employees). During this operation, the employees are placed in extreme circumstances due to the slope of dams. These areas are very difficult to simply walk on, or in the circumstance, walk and operate equipment. The City, on multiple occasions, had to send employees to urgent care due to bee stings (apparently bees like the conditions), twisted/sprained ankles, and injured backs. Additionally, equipment has been damaged due to the conditions, at no fault of the employees.\n\nAt this time, Staff is requesting to purchase an RC Slope Mower to add to our fleet. If approved, the mower would not only be utilized to maintain the dams, more than once a year, but will be used in other areas that have been requested to be maintained. These include areas along the Meramec riverbank where the brush hog cannot get into and the new flail mower cannot reach, areas in the Olde Towne Park and Fabick Nature Preserve, and newly cleared areas of honeysuckle to minimize the regrowth.\n\nThe cost of a new fifty-two-inch (52\") RC Slope Mower is $65,450 with options; however, a couple of used/low hour machines with a one-year warranty priced in the mid $40,000 are also available. If approved, this purchase would need to be added to the 2023 Capital Plan and would be paid for through Parks and Stormwater funds.\n\nAfter discussion, Alderman Cruts made a motion to forward to the April Board of Aldermen meeting the request to purchase a new TK-52XP RC Slope Mower. The motion was seconded by Alderman Clauss. Upon a vote being taken, the motion passed unanimously by the Board of Aldermen.\n\nEXECUTIVE SESSION\nAt 8:06 p.m. Alderman Clauss made a motion to enter into Executive Session pursuant to Section 610.021: (1) Legal actions, causes of action or litigation, (2) Leasing, purchase, or sale of real estate, and (13) Individually identifiable personnel records, performance ratings, or records pertaining to employees and or applicants for employment. The motion was seconded by Alderman Huels.\n\nUpon the roll being called, the Board of Aldermen voted as follows:\n\nAlderman Cruts                    Aye                      Alderman Clauss                    Aye\nAlderman Bereitschaft Aye                                  Alderman Huels                     Aye\nAlderman Wisbrock                 Aye                      Alderman Maserang                  Aye\nAlderman Harrell                  Aye                      Alderman Jokerst                  Aye\n\nIt was announced that the motion was passed by the Board of Aldermen.\n\nADJOURNMENT\nAt 9:01 p.m. Mayor Maurath reconvened the meeting, with no other business before the Board, Alderman Cruts made a motion to adjourn.
