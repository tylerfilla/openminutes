The\n                 parcel is addressed as 143 Cassens Court and is zoned \"IP-1\" Industrial Park District.\n\n                 Community Development Director Amy Starck reminded the Commission that this case was continued\n                 from     the   August meeting so that additional                      information about the              operation of the business could                   be\n                 provided. She commented that the tenant submitted information to address the Commissions concerns, and\n                 the standards in the Code for Transportation Facilities, noting that many of the requirements exceed state\n                 regulations.        She also noted that while lab testing was mentioned at the last meeting, it was confirmed by\n                 the applicant that this facility will not have a lab.\n\n                 The Petitioners, Corbin Holtzman,                     property owner, and Ryan                   Smith of Talaria approached.                  Mr.    Smith\n                 summarized the operation explaining that they are a secure logistics company operating in 27 states that\n                 does business to business transport of sealed marijuana. Mr. Smith added that they have an existing license\n                 in the     State    of Missouri        and     are   looking to       relocate to        Fenton.     He    explained that the company uses\n                 unmarked vans for discretion and the building will not have signage. He also explained that 100% of the\n                 product that applicant receives                 is sealed and nothing is visible from                     outside the facility.          In response to\n                 questions from the Commission, Mr. Smith explained that the facility is not a storage facility, but product\n                 may be temporarily held on-site within a secure room when deliveries cannot be made within a work day,\n                 but state requirements do not allow product to held for more than 72 hours.\n\n                 Mr.   Smith explained that security for the facility's                         operation includes continuous monitoring to, comply\n                with state regulations. There are always two (2) cameras on the product including in the building and on\n                the van at all times. A door is being added to the facility to allow vans to drive into the building so that any\n                transfer of product between vehicles occurs internally in secured areas. He added that all employees have\n                gone through background checks with the vast majority of the employees being retired law enforcement\n                officers. The building hours will be 7am to 5pm and because of the layers of security, will only need to be\n                staffed during those hours. To address traffic concerns, Mr. Smith stated the number of vans in and out\n                will be 5 to 10 at the beginning, but they see it rising to about 20 to 3 0 a day as they grow.\n\n                Mayor       Maurath        thanked       the    applicant       for   the    additional       information        and     stated     he   was     sorry     the\n                Commission did not have it last month.                        He also noted for the record that the applicant is required to have\n                certain certifications by the state and confirmed those certifications are or will be in place.\n\n                The Commission queried the Petitioner about the transport of money as that was mentioned during the\n                previous month's discussion. Mr. Smith answered that cash logistics will be handled by a separate business\n                and at no time does money and product co-mingle.\n\f\nA'lanning and Zoning Commission Meeting                                                                                                               Page3\nSeptember 5, 2023\n\n                 Following discussion, Chairperson Yeoman read aloud the conditions of approval.

A\n                copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department. She explained that a SUP\n                was approved in April for Stars Liquor and Tobacco; however, the Petitioner recently established a new\n                corporate entity and business name. Additionally, the Board approved a text amendment in May to add\n                Tobacco Shops to the Code as a Use that now requires a SUP in \"OT-2\". Since Special Use Permits are\n                non-transferrable, and a SUP is now needed for Tobacco Shops, the Petitioner is seeking a new SUP. No\n                changes to the operation of the business are proposed.\n\n                The Petitioner, Abier Mseitif, approached. There were no questions for the Petitioner.\n\n                Chairperson Yeoman read aloud the conditions of approval.

The property is zoned \"IP-1\" Industrial\n                 Park District.\n\n                 Community Development Director Amy Starck gave a summary of the Staff report to the Commission. A\n                 copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department.\n\n                 The Petitioners, Laura and Rob Powers approached. The Petitioners explained that they are proposing a\n                 basketball franchise.            It is   an   emerging       brand with 30           around      the Country and one (1)                in   the   State of\n                 Georgia. They will have shooting cages and skills stations that use geospatial technology to provide virtual\n                 interactive      training.      They     will    also    have    former      professional        basketball       players     offering training          and\n                 coaching       to   small     groups      of kids.       The     Petitioner explained            that    that   patrons      can    either    enroll     in a\n                 membership program (monthly,                      bi-annually,       or annually) or pay by the hour.                    In   response to questions\n                 about available parking, Mr. Powers stated that they only anticipate 12-15 kids at one time with most being\n                 dropped off. Additionally, the hours will vary based on the season, with summer hours between 10am-8pm\n                 and winter hours between 2pm-9pm. The Petitioner stated that industrial buildings are ideal for these types\n                 of facilities      because they need             tall   ceilings,     and    most franchise          locations      are   also    in   industrial     areas.\n                 Additionally, another recreational facility for batting cages is located in the adjacent building, so there are\n                 no concerns with traffic.\n\n                 Chairperson Yeoman read aloud the conditions of approval. The Petitioner agreed to all.\n\n                 Conditions of Approval:\n                       1.

The parcel is addressed as 143 Cassens Court and is zoned \"IP-1\" Industrial Park District.\n\nCommunity Development Director Amy Starck reminded the Commission that this case was continued from the August meeting so that additional information about the operation of the business could be provided. She commented that the tenant submitted information to address the Commission's concerns, and the standards in the Code for Transportation Facilities, noting that many of the requirements exceed state regulations. She also noted that while lab testing was mentioned at the last meeting, it was confirmed by the applicant that this facility will not have a lab.\n\nThe Petitioners, Corbin Holtzman, property owner, and Ryan Smith of Talaria approached. Mr. Smith summarized the operation explaining that they are a secure logistics company operating in 27 states that does business to business transport of sealed marijuana. Mr. Smith added that they have an existing license in the State of Missouri and are looking to relocate to Fenton. He explained that the company uses unmarked vans for discretion and the building will not have signage. He also explained that 100% of the product that applicant receives is sealed and nothing is visible from outside the facility. In response to questions from the Commission, Mr. Smith explained that the facility is not a storage facility, but product may be temporarily held on-site within a secure room when deliveries cannot be made within a work day, but state requirements do not allow product to held for more than 72 hours.\n\nMr. Smith explained that security for the facility's operation includes continuous monitoring to comply with state regulations. There are always two (2) cameras on the product including in the building and on the van at all times. A door is being added to the facility to allow vans to drive into the building so that any transfer of product between vehicles occurs internally in secured areas. He added that all employees have gone through background checks with the vast majority of the employees being retired law enforcement officers. The building hours will be 7am to 5pm and because of the layers of security, will only need to be staffed during those hours. To address traffic concerns, Mr. Smith stated the number of vans in and out will be 5 to 10 at the beginning, but they see it rising to about 20 to 30 a day as they grow.\n\nMayor Maurath thanked the applicant for the additional information and stated he was sorry the Commission did not have it last month. He also noted for the record that the applicant is required to have certain certifications by the state and confirmed those certifications are or will be in place.\n\nThe Commission queried the Petitioner about the transport of money as that was mentioned during the previous month's discussion. Mr. Smith answered that cash logistics will be handled by a separate business and at no time does money and product co-mingle.\n\nFollowing discussion, Chairperson Yeoman read aloud the conditions of approval. The Petitioner agreed to all.\n\nConditions of Approval:\n1. This Special Use Permit approval is solely for Talaria MO, LLC to operate a Marijuana Transportation Facility at 2275 Cassens Drive, Suite 130, in accordance with Chapter 430, Article IX of the Zoning Code. Said use does not include laboratory testing or certifying of Marijuana.\n2. Proof of State Licensing, as required under Section 430.680 of the Zoning Code, must be provided to the Community Development Director before an Occupancy Permit is issued for the subject location.\n3. Proposed interior renovations to the subject location will require a separate Building Permit.\n4. Compliance with all other applicable City Codes and Ordinances.\n\nChairperson Yeoman made a motion to APPROVE with conditions, CASE 2023-SUP-11. Alderman Harrell seconded the motion.\n\nRoll Call:\nChairperson Callan Yeoman Aye\nVice-Chairperson Kevin Sherrel Aye\nSecretary Deborah Abbott Aye\nCommissioner Bill Voorhees Aye\nCommissioner Warren Wisbrock Aye\nCommissioner Bill Glover Absent\nCommissioner Linda Nelson Aye\nCommissioner John Bielicki Aye\nAlderman Ron Harrell Aye\nMayor Joe Maurath Aye\n\n9 Ayes; 0 Nays; 1 Absent: Motion APPROVED\n\nNEW BUSINESS:\n\nCASE 2023-SUP-12: A Petition by Abier Mseitif of S&H Spirit, Inc. dba Fenton Liquor and Tobacco for a Special Use Permit to operate a Liquor Store and Tobacco Shop at 645 Gravois Road. The property is zoned \"OT-2\" Olde Towne District.\n\nCommunity Development Director Amy Starck gave a summary of the Staff report to the Commission. A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department. She explained that a SUP was approved in April for Stars Liquor and Tobacco; however, the Petitioner recently established a new corporate entity and business name. Additionally, the Board approved a text amendment in May to add Tobacco Shops to the Code as a Use that now requires a SUP in \"OT-2\". Since Special Use Permits are non-transferrable, and a SUP is now needed for Tobacco Shops, the Petitioner is seeking a new SUP. No changes to the operation of the business are proposed.\n\nThe Petitioner, Abier Mseitif, approached. There were no questions for the Petitioner.\n\nChairperson Yeoman read aloud the conditions of approval. The Petitioner agreed to all.\n\nConditions of Approval:\n1. Approval of the Special Use Permit is for S&H Spirit, Inc. dba Fenton Liquor and Tobacco to operate a Liquor Store at 645 Gravois Road, as indicated on the plans provided with the application and dated July 25, 2023.\n2.

A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department.\n\nThe Petitioners, Laura and Rob Powers approached. The Petitioners explained that they are proposing a basketball franchise. It is an emerging brand with 30 around the Country and one (1) in the State of Georgia. They will have shooting cages and skills stations that use geospatial technology to provide virtual interactive training. They will also have former professional basketball players offering training and coaching to small groups of kids. The Petitioner explained that that patrons can either enroll in a membership program (monthly, bi-annually, or annually) or pay by the hour. In response to questions about available parking, Mr. Powers stated that they only anticipate 12-15 kids at one time with most being dropped off. Additionally, the hours will vary based on the season, with summer hours between 10am-8pm and winter hours between 2pm-9pm. The Petitioner stated that industrial buildings are ideal for these types of facilities because they need tall ceilings, and most franchise locations are also in industrial areas. Additionally, another recreational facility for batting cages is located in the adjacent building, so there are no concerns with traffic.\n\nChairperson Yeoman read aloud the conditions of approval. The Petitioner agreed to all.\n\nConditions of Approval:\n1. This Special Use Permit is solely for L and R Group Corp to operate an Indoor Limited Recreational Facility at 2045 Hitzert Court.\n2.
