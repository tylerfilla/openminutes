   DISCUSSION OF AMENDMENTS TO THE COMPREHENSIVE DEVLOPEMT PLAN

           Community Development Director Amy Starck gave a presentation and provided a draft of the
           proposed   changes   to the   Comprehensive    Plan for   discussion. A   copy   of the PowerPoint
           presentation is attached for the record and copies of corresponding documents provided to the
           Commission are on file with the Community Development Department.

           Director Starck explained the Overview, Goals, and Objectives of the Olde Towne Planning Area.
           She noted that the current Comprehensive Plan includes the Olde Towne area and the commercial
           areas of the City into one Planning Area designation, and Staff is proposing that these areas be
           divided into separate Planning Areas as they are very different.      As this area encompasses the
           original 8 blocks,   attention has been   paid to its historic significance   with regard   to future
           redevelopment. She also pointed out the unique mix of commercial and residential developments
           in the Planning Area.

           The Commission discussed the Olde Towne Redevelopment Plan adopted in 2000 as well as more
           diverse housing   (multi-family, apartments,   etc.). Director Starck noted   that the Olde   Towne
           Redevelopment Plan and Multi-Family/Apartment developments rely            on there being available
           land within the Planning Area to redevelop, which is currently not the case. Mayor Maurath noted
           that because this area is prone to flooding, it is good that develo'pment in this area hasn't been
          pushed. He also mentioned that there have been new single-family homes built in the area with
          more to come. Additional discussion was held regarding residential dwellings in non-residential
          areas. Director Starck noted that residential dwellings in certain non-residential areas would need
          to comply with the Zoning Code as well as the Comprehensive Plan.

          Discussion was held regarding the lack of parking in the Olde Towne area and how that impacts
          future redevelopment. Director Starck noted that this Planning Area seeks to encourage pedestrian
          traffic and small-scale businesses to address the lack of parking,

          Following discussion, Chairperson Yeoman called an additional workshop session at 6:00 p.m. in
          advance of the July 11, 2023 meeting to discuss amendments to the remaining Planning Areas of
          the Comprehensive Plan.

  ADJOURNMENT:           6:57 p.m.

          A motion to adjourn was made by Chairperson Yeoman and seconded by Commissioner Nelson.
          The motion was unanimously approved by voice vote.

          Respectfully submitted,
