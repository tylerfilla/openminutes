OLD BUSINESS:
•    Discussion regarding Pickleball Courts at Fenton City Park.
     During the August Meeting, the Committee requested that the City obtain pricing for a concrete
     pickleball court in Fenton City Park. Staff obtained some pricing that was available for review.

     City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner shared the estimate for court surface (that would be two (2)
     courts) concrete only, no fencing or other items is $25,000-$30,000.

     After discussion, Mary Heinemann made a motion for Staff to obtain quotes for two (2) - four (4)
     Pickleball Courts in Fenton City Park, constructed with standard pickleball court materials and with
     needed fencing, nets, etc. for further consideration. Gary Johnson seconded the motion.

         7 Ayes; 0 Nays, 0 Absent, 0 Abstain:          Motion APPROVED by voice vote.

NEW BUSINESS:
•   Discussion regarding proposed information signage in City Parks.
    In August, the Committee discussed a proposed design for new informational signage in City Parks.
    Based on the     Committee's recommendation, Staff reached out to three (3) sign vendors for                    design
    templates and pricing information. One (1) sign vendor declined to provide a quote due to the type of
    sign. However, two (2) sign vendors that have previously provided signs for the City (Pfitzinger
    Graphics and Piros Signs) did provide design templates and quotes and were available for review.

    It is noted that the City budgeted $20,000 in the 2024 Capital Plan for new signage in the parks.

    City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner suggested park hours be a larger font and speed limit font be
    smaller than proposed.

    After discussion, Gary Johnson made a motion to approve nine (9) new informational signs in City
    Parks as proposed by Piros Signs Option A. I (attached as part of the minutes) and Piros providing the
    installation with an estimated cost of $1,889.00 per sign with installation totaling $17,001.00 with
    park hours in a larger font and speed limit in a smaller font. Phillip Van Cleave seconded the motion.

         7 Ayes; 0 Nays, 0 Absent, 0 Abstain:         Motion APPROVED by voice vote.

•   Discussion regarding Parks and Recreation projects for the 2024 Fiscal Year Budget.
    Per Chapter 130 Parks and Recreation Committee, Section 130.060, Budget, of the Municipal Code,
    "The Committee may, on or before the October Committee meeting each year, submit to the Mayor
    and   Board of Aldermen         for approval,    a proposed     budget for    parks   and   recreation   projects. In
    establishing the budget for the City, the Board of Aldermen shall utilize the Committee budget, if
    submitted, as an advisory document".

    Park   projects are   placed   on the   City's Capital    Plan and    are typically   projects that will    cost over
    $5,000. For reference, a list of park projects in the 2023 Capital Plan was available for review. It was
    noted that projects not completed in the current year (2023) are typically rolled over to the next fiscal
    year (2024 ).

    Based on the above, the Committee should discuss any park projects they may want to see in 2024 so
    that a budget for the same can be presented to the Board for consideration no later than the second
    Board of Aldermen Committee Meeting in October.
