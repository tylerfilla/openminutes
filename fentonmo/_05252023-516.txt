                          •       Spector, Wolfe, & O'Mara, LLC, 414 Gravois Road, law office

                Infrastructure (CFI) Grant for EV's at Wally's, as discussed at the May 4                                                                                                         Committee
                Meeting.
                •        City Attorney Erin Seele explained that after further review of the grant program, there is
                         a provision that allows the City to proceed with a subrecipient route which does not require
                         a formal competitive process or an RFQ process that is subject to federal grant competitive
                         bid procedures.                     Since the City would need Francis Energy's assistance to complete the
                         application, it makes sense for the City to proceed with the application and identify Francis
                         Energy as a subrecipient.                                    A subrecipient means a non-Federal entity that receives a
                         subaward from a pass-through entity to carry out part of a Federal program. The City
                         would be required to meet the grant requirements as would Francis Energy. City Attorney
                         Erin See le recommended that if the Board would choose to proceed with the grant to have
                         Francis Energy as a subrecipient.

                                                                                                        6

                                                                                              May 25 2023

            Mayor Maurath inquired on legal considerations. City Attorney Erin Seele shared it is required
            that there be a private entity involved with this grant and per the requirement, the private entity
            is required to match the grants twenty percent (20%) requirement.

            Matt Jones, Francis Energy was present via videoconference and had no further comments.

            Mayor Maurath asked if Staff agreed with findings. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner replied
           yes.

           Mayor Maurath inquired for the record that the twenty percent (20%) match is legally required
           to be paid by the private entity, not the City of Fenton. Mr. Jones replied yes that is correct.

           After discussion, Alderman Bereitschaft made a motion to approve request by Francis Energy
           for the City to apply for a Charging and Fueling Infrastructure (CFI) Grant for EV's at Wally's,
           with Francis Energy as a subrecipient. The motion was seconded by Alderman Cruts. Upon a
           vote being taken,          it was announced that the motion passed unanimously by the Board of
           Aldermen.

  Paul Williams, Premier Hotel, 2523 S. Franklin Kirksville MO. Mr. Williams shared the Petitioner,
  Jiten Patel, purchased the proposed property with partners in 2006. In 2013, when he purchased another
  property in Kansas City, he left operations and building upkeep to his partners until 2017. The partners
  did not keep up the property, did not pay the bills, and left the problems for Mr. Patel.                                          In 2019, Mr.
  Patel bought out his partners. Mr. Patel incurred costs for plans and engineering for a proposed 4 (four)
  story Hotel (Baymont Inn & Suites) where the existing northern-most Hotel building and pool area are
  located, leaving the southern-most building to be operated as a separate, independent Hotel from the
  Baymont Inn & Suites. In 2020, the COVID pandemic occurred making it difficult to secure funding
  for hospitality. During that time, Mr. Patel invested approximately $200,000 to try to maintain the
  property, the investment made little to no visible improvements.

  Mr. Williams shared Mr. Patel believes that removing the current building and building a new property
  is the correct use of the land and the only way to obtain an acceptable return on investment. Mr. Patel
changed plans from a lower mid-scale hotel brand to an upper scale hotel brand. Through the Hilton
  brand     the   loan     requires      four    percent (4%)          of revenue         to   be   allocated       to an     escrow for        asset
maintenance.
