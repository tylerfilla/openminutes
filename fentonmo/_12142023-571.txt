PLANNING AND ZONING COMMISSION REPORT -Aid Harrell, Liaison
❖ Announcements:
     •     The Commission approved R-23-0 l: A Resolution adopting amendments to the City of Fenton
           Comprehensive Development Plan.
❖ Public Hearing:
     There were no public hearings.

❖ Other recommendations from the Planning and Zoning:

                                                     Board of Aldermen Meeting
                                                          December 14, 2023

      •     Approval, with conditions, of CASE 2023-SPR-05: A Petition by Michael P. Johnson of
            BestBox Storage Fenton, LLC for Site Plan Review of alternative exterior building material
            for a    proposed       Self-Storage Facility at 74 7             Gravois Road.          The property         is zoned     "C-1"
            Commercial District.

            Garen Miller, Senior Project Architect for the Petitioner, shared he spoke with the senior
            partners regarding the recommendation to consider alternative exterior building material as
            discussed at meetings; the partners said no to the recommendation based on branding and
            accessibility.       MSD       required double the amount of water retention than expected, which
            restricted the site and what Best Box does best is provide ample space around the site, so he is
            asking to stick with the corporate design.

            Alderman Jokerst inquired if approved if it would set a precedent. City Attorney Erin Seele
            shared it is in the City Code that an exception may be authorized that allows exterior finishes
            that do not meet City Code if deemed prototypical for corporate or market identity.

            Alderman Harrell suggested Petitioner submit better pictures and sample materials of proposal
            for further review and asked if there was something completed, he could look at to see what
            this proposal will really look like. Mr. Miller shared as the company was formed in 2020, to
            date there are no completed projects in the area.                         He noted Wentzville location is almost
            complete, but it has a completely different look because it is single-story.                                  He can provide
            additional information, but they feel it will delay the project and feel the material is adequate
            for their corporate design and discussed color schemes.

            Mayor Maurath voiced he feels the colors proposed are acceptable but is unsure of proposed
            exterior building materials. It is difficult to determine corporate identity as nothing has been
            completed for identity. The challenges regarding Metropolitan Sewer District (MSD) are not
            part of the consideration of the building materials. The surrounding buildings are masonry and
            feels the City should uphold to get the best product.

           Alderman        Harrell made          a   motion     to continue Case 2023-SPR-04 with conditions to the
           January Board of Aldermen Committee meeting to allow Petitioner time to submit samples and
           pictures. The motion was seconded by Alderman Wisbrock. Upon a vote being taken, it was
           announced that the motion was passed unanimously by the Board of Aldermen.

      •    Approval, with conditions, of CASE 2023-SP-03: A Petition by Kind Goods Fenton, LLC for
           a Sign Plan for proposed Wall Signs at 180 Gravois Bluffs Circle, Suite B. The property is
           zoned "C-1" Commercial District.

           Alderman Harrell made a motion to approve Case 2023-SP-034 with conditions. The motion
           was seconded by Alderman Cruts. Upon a vote being taken, it was announced that the motion
           was passed unanimously by the Board of Aldermen.
