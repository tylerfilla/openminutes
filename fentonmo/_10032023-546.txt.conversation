Also, at the request of the\n          Commission, Staff drafted specific parameters based on previous discussions regarding possible limited\n          mixed-use developments in the Commercial Area to aid the Commission in determining whether or not\n          this was something they wanted to include.

City Attorney Erin Seele explained should they be         included, the Commission       is\n             opening the door to residential use in the Commercial Area, but through a planned district there is ability\n            to control the proportionality and     to ensure it is a true mixed-use development. \\She added a planned\n             district is a legislative decision as it is a rezoning, and that gives the City more discretion.\n\n            Additional discussion was held concerning the benefits of being forward thinking for the community, the\n             impact such a development may have on revenues for the City, and whether the Commercial Planning\n            Area would be appropriate for residential activities. Chairperson Yeoman commented that revenue should\n            not be the driving factor, but the question is how the City wants residential and commercial to interact and\n            he has concerns with merging residential and commercial uses in the same development because he feels it\n            does not reflect the character and nature of Fenton as a community. Clear, distinct districts - commercial,\n            residential, parks, industrial - are more in line with the character and nature of the City.    Vice-Chairperson\n             Sherrel cautioned that the City needs to stay cognizant of change and questioned whether the Commission\n            could revisit the Comprehensive Plan if there is a sense that trends necessitate a review. It was answered\n            that the Commission can revisit the Comprehensive Plan should they see a need to do so.\n\n            Following discussion, it was determined that the Commission did not want the Commercial Planning Area\n            of the Comprehensive Plan to consider residential developments, including mixed-use developments.\n\n    ADJOURNMENT:           6:57 p.m.\n\n            A motion to adjourn was       made by Chairperson Yeoman and          seconded by Commissioner Nelson.
