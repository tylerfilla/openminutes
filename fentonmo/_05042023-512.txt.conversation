Missouri Department\nof Conservation (MDC) recently restocked Westside Park lake, and MDC noted it is normal that a few fish\nmay die in the process. MDC further suggested that the muskrats be removed from the lake.\n\nPUBLIC COMMENTS\n      There were no public comments.\n\nPOLICE/MUNICIPAL COURTS - (Clauss, Cruts, Harrell, Jokerst)\n\u2022     Election of the Committee Chairperson.\n\n      Alderman Jokerst made a motion to appoint Alderman Clauss. The motion was seconded by Alderman\n      Harrell. Upon a vote being taken, it was announced that the motion was unanimously passed by the\n      Committee.\n\n\u2022     Consideration of a request to purchase a water fountain/ bottle filling station for the Fenton\n      Precinct.\n      The Fenton Precinct is requesting a new water fountain/bottle filling station to replace the existing\n      water fountain within the Fenton Precinct station.\n\n      A request was made to repair the existing water fountain due to the lack of or no water pressure making\n      the fountain not usable. Repair for this fountain will be approximately $100 for parts that are on back\n      order, then labor time for the repair.\n\n      A new fountain water filling station costs range from $1,000 to $1,300. It would make sense to be more\n      ecofriendly by installing a bottle filling station and putting any funds towards a new fountain rather\n      than repairing the outdated existing fountain.\n\n      Alderman Jokerst expressed she likes the bottle filling station suggestion and inquired if there were\n      other fountains that need to be replaced in other areas. Mayor Maurath reaffirmed the request on the\n      agenda is a request to repair or replace fountain for precinct station and noted there was a kitchen within\n     the precinct where bottles could be filled.               Alderman Wisbrock clarified if fountain under consideration\n     was in the City Hall lobby or in the precinct. Alderman Clauss replied it was the fountain within the\n     precinct station.\n\n     City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner suggested replacing the water fountain in the City Hall lobby with\n     a new fountain/bottle filling station as it would be better utilized by the public and Staff and repair the\n     fountain in the precinct station. Alderman Wisbrock and Alderman Jokerst expressed they would be in\n     favor of her suggestion.\n\n     Following discussion, Alderman Clauss made a motion to forward to the May Board of Aldennen\n     meeting the consideration of a request to purchase a water fountain/bottle filling station for the City\n     Hall lobby and repair the water fountain in the Fenton Precinct. The motion was seconded by Alderman\n     Harrell. Upon a vote being taken, it was announced that the motion was unanimously passed by the\n     Committee.\n\n\u2022    Consideration of a request by the Emergency Operations Center to utilize an open space in the\n     Community Development Building if needed during an emergency.\n     The St. Louis County Emergency Operations Center (EOC) is requesting to use an open space in the\n     Community Development Department ( former Library space) as needed in the event of an emergency.\n\n                                                                               2\n                                                           Board of Aldermen Committee Meeting,\n                                                                         May 4, 2023\n\f\n      Per the EOC the existing tables, chairs, and power within the space are adequate for their needs, but if\n      needed they would be able to provide additional amenities for the operations.\n\n      The proposed temporary location would not have an impact on the separate/secured office space utilized\n      by the Missouri Highway Patrol or the Community Development Department.\n\n      Alderman Clauss made a motion to approve consideration of a request by the EOC to utilize an open\n      space in     the Community Development Building if needed during an emergency. The motion was\n      seconded by Alderman Jokerst.\n\n      Alderman Jokerst inquired if a generator would be needed. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner replied\n      no they would provide additional amenities needed for the operations.\n\n      Captain Lawson explained the EOC is requesting this location as they may not always have authorized\n      access to their current back up location.\n\n      Aldennan Maserang inquired if this would conflict with State Highway usage. City Administrator Nikki\n      Finkbiner replied, no.\n\n      Following discussion, the motion was unanimously approved by the Committee.\n\n      Following further discussion, Aldennan Clauss made a motion to open the topic to the full Board.\n     The motion was seconded by Aldennan Jokerst. Upon a vote being taken, it was announced that the\n      motion was unanimously passed by the Committee.\n\n     Aldennan Clauss made a final motion to approve consideration of a request by the EOC to utilize an\n     open space in the Community Development Building if needed during an emergency. The motion was\n     seconded by Alderman Jokerst.

The motion was seconded by\n     Aldennan Harrell. Upon a vote being taken, it was announced that the motion was unanimously passed\n     by the Committee.\n\n\u2022    Consideration of a request by Francis Energy for the City to apply for a Charging and Fueling\n     Infrastructure (CFI) Grant for EV's at Wally's.\n     The Charging and Fueling Infrastructure (CFI) Grant Program has made available $700 million dollars\n     from FY2022 and FY2023 to strategically deploy electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure across\n     the country, particularly in urban, rural, and                    disadvantaged communities.                Private entities such as\n     Wally's and Francis Energy are not eligible applicants, but municipalities such as the City of Fenton\n     are. The CFI grant requires an 80/20 cost share. If this project were to be awarded, Francis Energy\n                                                                                3\n                                                            Board of Aldennen Committee Meeting,\n                                                                          May 4, 2023\n\f\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                      11\nwould provide the 20% match. The application for this round of funding is due on May 30                                                                                                                                1, and Francis\nEnergy is prepared to provide grant writing support.\n\nWally's proposes that the City of Fenton submit an application to upgrade the existing Francis Energy\ninfrastructure at Wally's                                       Fenton located at 950 Assembly Parkway,                                                                     Fenton, MO 63026. There                                            are\ncurrently two 60kW charging ports that can charge two cars simultaneously. This project will upgrade\nthe station capacity to charge at least four(4) cars simultaneously at l 50kWh each, meeting the National\nElectric               Vehicle               Infrastructure                      Standards.                   Seeing             that         Wally's               is     conveniently                       located             near         the\nintersection of 1-44 and 1-270, this location could serve the citizens of Fenton while also drawing\ninterstate travelers into the City of Fenton and nearby various local businesses. Francis Energy is also\nopen to including other interested site hosts, public or private, on this application.\n\nAlderman Jokerst asked for clarification is request for City status to obtain grant funding for private\ncompany. Mayor Maurath shared the City would need to apply for the grant, if approved it is an 80/20\ncost share that Francis Energy would pay the 20% match.\n\nMatt Jones, Francis Energy was present via videoconference. Mr. Jones shared they would like to\npartner with the City for the CFI grant funding.                                                                     The first round of funding offers up to $700 million in\n2022-2023. The grant will fund up to 80% of the cost of building charging infrastructure and as a\npartnership with the City they would provide the 20% match cost as the municipality is eligible to apply\nfor the grant and they are not. They built the current 60kW charge system at Wally's in 2022. They\ncould upgrade that into four (4) l 50kW system.\n\nAlderman Clauss inquired why City should consider applying for a grant for private entity instead of\nthe City applying for and installing charging system themselves.\n\nMr. Jones shared the consideration could be for other areas beyond Wally's location. There are two (2)\ntypes of grants: (L3) Corridor Charging Grants, to be used along state-designated corridors, and (L2)\nCommunity Charging Grants, to install EV charging in public places such as schools, grocery stores,\nparks, libraries, or multi-family sites and must be publicly accessible.\n\nAlderman Bereitschaft expressed he feels Fenton residents would not benefit with charging station as\nthey would utilize their own system at their home and inquired if City applied for the grant how the\nfinancial process transpires. Mr. Jones replied 80-90% of charging does take place at home, but there\nis a benefit to attract people off a major corridor that will also shop and eat at the local business. Mr.\nJones explained the City receives the funding and is dispersed for approved projects outlined in the\ngrant.\n\nAlderman Maserang inquired if consideration is driven by current demand or anticipated demand and\nfurther inquired if City received funding would it hinder eligibility for future grants for the City. Mr.\nJones shared EV sales are increasing but there are also reservations due to range of available charging\nsystems to get from point A to point B. This is an investment to reduce the range anxiety. He assumes\nthe City would be eligible to apply for any round of funding.\n\nAlderman Jokerst shared she would like to consider additional charging locations within the City. She\nfurther inquired if revenues generated would be 100% to Francis Energy or would it be split with the\nCity. Mr. Jones explained they typically have ground leases, flat rate or an agreed percentage whichever\nis higher, and Francis Energy would own, operate, upgrade, and maintain the system.\n\nCity Attorney Erin Seele inquired on grant agreement terms the City would need to consider. Mr. Jones\nshared             it is       a five            (5) year agreement, outlining liability,                                                            operations, maintenance, and                                               reporting\n\n                                                                                                                                 4\n                                                                                               Board of Aldermen Committee Meeting,\n                                                                                                                       May 4, 2023\n\f\nresponsibility and he would provide a copy of the agreement terms for review. If the grant would be\napproved, the project would require a Request for Proposals (RFP) of which they would submit a\nproposal for the project, that can be run concurrently with the grant application. Mr. Jones reminded\n                                                                                                                                             1\nthe Board the deadline to submit the grant is May 30\u00b0                                                                                          .\n\nCity Administrator Nikki Finkbiner asked Mr. Jones to explain where the funding came from. Mr. Jones\nexplained the U.S. Department of Transportation's new CFI grant program, was established by the\nBipartisan Infrastructure Law passed in 2021, that will provide Federal funds of $2.5 billion over five\n(5) years to applicants from cities, counties, local governments, and Tribes.\n\nAlderman Clauss expressed she feels if charging station would be installed at City Hall or other City\nproperty it could benefit City employees that would need to charge their vehicles.\n\nAlderman Huels inquired if additional locations would be considered at this time, would it slow down\n                                                                                                                                            th\nthe submittal process of this request with the May 30                                                                                           deadline. Mr. Jones replied he did not believe it\nwould and shared they would help with the additional request to the extent the procurement laws would\nallow.\n\nAldennan Wisbrock asked how many charging stations are currently at Wally's.                                                                                                                                                  Mr. Jones replied\ncurrently there are two (2) 60kW charging stations. Alderman Wisbrock expressed he feels additional\nlocations would better serve public access in locations close to roadways, gas stations, shopping center\nrather than parks, RiverChase YMCA, or City Hall and feels that if located on City property after the\nfive (5) year agreement is expired the City will not be able to maintain the infrastructure as needed. Mr.\nJones explained the federal funding will help provided maintenance for the first five (5) years and\ntypically                  leases             run         fifteen              to       twenty               (15-20)                years,             however as                          Francis               Energy                 would              be        the\nowner/operator, they would continue maintenance and liability for the life of the infrastructure.\n\nCity Administrator Nikki Finkbiner inquired if this was the only submission opportunity for this grant\nor if additional applications for other locations could be submitted annually. Mr. Jones replied the first\ntwo (2) fiscal years have been combined into this application, however there will be three (3) more\nfiscal years to submit future applications and believes they will be more difficult and competitive the\nlonger the programs is open.                                                     City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner further inquired if Francis Energy\nsought out other locations within Fenton for consideration to make this application more robust. Mr.\nJones stated he would verify with their acquisition team ifthere were other leases for consideration in\nthe area. Typically, they take the lead from the community for location sites.\n\nKevin Herdler, Executive Director, St. Louis Regional Clean Cities was present at the meeting. Mr.\nHerdler stated he would be available to assist the City if there would be consideration of additional\napplications in the future. He further explained, the Corridor Grant they are requesting allows them to\nconnect Oklahoma and Missouri as a Route 66 electric highway and the program wants the higher\ncharging stations on these roadways approximately each one hundred fifty ( 150) miles. If moved\nforward, this would be the first National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) in Missouri.\n\nMayor Maurath shared he feels more consideration needs to be given before moving forward and further\ninquired how would the City receive revenue from the charging station as it is not City property. Mr.\nHerdler explained through utility tax revenue.\n\nCity Administrator Nikki Finkbiner asked if there was an agreement outlining liabilities, maintenance,\npayment, etc. that can be reviewed, and noted that the City could be required to have a single audit\ncompleted if this grant was awarded and track both revenue and expenses ofthe grant. Mr. Jones shared\nFrancis Energy would pay the expenses for the construction of the project and submit requests for\n\n                                                                                                                                              5\n                                                                                                        Board of Aldermen Committee Meeting,\n                                                                                                                                  May 4, 2023\n\f\n      reimbursement to the City up to the 80% cost. Mayor Maurath inquired on safeguards for financial\n      liability. Mr. Jones stated there are required construction bonds that would be in place.\n\n      After discussion, Alderman Bereitschaft made a motion to forward to the May Board of Aldermen\n     meeting the consideration of request by Francis Energy for the City to apply for a Charging and Fueling\n     Infrastructure (CFI) Grant for EV's at Wally's and have City Attorney review terms in agreement. The\n     motion was seconded by Alderman Maserang. Upon a vote being taken, it was announced that the\n     motion was unanimously passed by the Committee.\n\n     Alderman Jokerst inquired if topic can be reconsidered in future for additional locations for next years\n     submission. There were no objections.\n\nCAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS- (Bereitschaft, Harrell, Huels, Maserang)\n\u2022    Election of the Committee Chairperson.\n\n     Alderman       Huels     made     a motion      to appoint Alderman Maserang.                 The motion was          seconded      by\n     Alderman Harrell. Upon a vote being taken, it was announced that the motion was unanimously passed\n     by the Committee.\n\nPUBLIC WORKS/FORESTRY - (Wisbrock, Bereitschaft, Clauss, Maserang)\n\u2022    Election of the Committee Chairperson.\n\n     Alderman Wisbrock made a motion to appoint Alderman Wisbrock. The motion was seconded by\n     Alderman Maserang.\n\n     Alderman Bereitschaft inquired that with his background of 45 years as a carpenter and 30 of those\n     years as a superintendent if he could do more for Public Works as the Chairperson. Alderman Huels\n     shared her concern is that it is not the role of Chairperson to oversee projects or get deeply involved in\n     the daily operations of the department, the role is reporting to the Board. Alderman Maserang agreed.\n     Mayor Maurath shared he feels the Chairperson has a total understanding of focus and issues within\n     the committee and communications with the Staff and committee.\n\n     Upon a vote being taken, it was announced that the motion was unanimously passed by the Committee.\n\n\u2022    Consideration of bids for the 2023 Bud Weil Park Roof Replacement Project.\n     The City held the bid opening for the 2023 Bud Weil Park Roof Replacement Project on April 27, 2023\n     at 10:00 a.m. Two (2) bids were submitted for consideration: Jeffco Guttering and Allen Roofing and\n     Siding.\n\n     With the unit pricing provided by both bidders to replace the roofs with architectural asphalt shingles,\n     Jeffco Guttering submitted the lowest responsive bid of $17,683.00. At this time, it is requested to\n     award the contract to replace the roofs at Bud Weil Park to Jeffco Guttering.\n\n     A bid alternate was included to provide pricing to replace the roofs with metal roofing in lieu of the\n     asphalt shingles. If the Board so desires, there is an option to replace one ( 1) or all roofs with metal\n     roofing. Please see the bid sheet from Jeffco Guttering. Allen Roofing indicated they do not install\n     metal roofing.\n\n     Alderman       Wisbrock       made     a   motion     to   forward     to the    May     Board     of Aldermen         meeting     the\n     consideration of bids for the 2023 Bud Weil Park Roof Replacement Project with Jeffco Guttering as\n     recommended. The motion was seconded by Alderman Maserang.\n                                                                            6\n                                                         Board of Aldennen Committee Meeting,\n                                                                       May4, 2023\n\f\n      Alderman Jokerst inquired if metal roofing lasted longer than shingles. Public Works Director Dan\n      Howard shared after the flood in 2015, the City has been using metal roofing on all the shelters in the\n      main park. Metal roofing is designed and warrantied to last for thirty (30) years vs. fifteen to twenty\n      (15-20) years for asphalt shingle roofing and is not affected as much by hail or wind damage. The\n      option is for comparison. Public Works Director Dan Howard expressed he is in favor of shingles for\n      aesthetics and history of Bud Weil Park.\n\n      Alderman Bereitschaft inquired if metal vs. shingle would affect insurance cost. City Administrator\n      Nikki Finkbiner replied no.\n\n      Mayor Maurath inquired on the bone structure of the buildings. Public Works Director Dan Howard\n      shared the structures are in great shape however, there are cosmetic issues that need to be addressed.\n      Cochran Engineering did a brief survey, they stated the oldest structure, being the house, is in good\n      shape.\n\n      Public Works Director Dan Howard shared Allen Roofing and Siding did not submit an addendum that\n      was provided for facia on the main pavilion and hexagon shelter and further stated they do not install\n      metal roofing.\n\n      There was discussion of safety concerns with metal roofing such as kids throwing rocks on the roof of\n      the restroom structure, climbing on it and other concerns. Alderman Wisbrock inquired if the restroom\n      should be an asphalt roof and main pavilion and hexagon shelter be metal roofing. Alderman Jokerst\n      expressed       she   feels    for   aesthetics      all roofing       should     be the     same.     Alderman Harrell,            Alderman\n      Wisbrock, Alderman Bereitschaft, and Alderman Clauss agreed.\n\n      Alderman Clauss inquired if the asphalt shingles were construction grade. Public Works Director Dan\n      Howard responded no, they are architectural grade shingles and wear better. Public Works Director\n      Dan Howard shared metal roofing shows more chalking buildup from pollen and with safety concerns\n      on the restroom structure he is in favor of asphalt shingles.\n\n      Alderman Huels noted for the record that Jeffco Guttering will be performing work at her house, for\n      transparency.        Alderman Clauss also stated the Jeffco Guttering has performed several projects at her\n      house and they did a very good job.\n\n      Upon a vote being taken, it was announced that the motion was unanimously passed by the Committee.\n\n\u2022    Consideration of an extension to the contract with Aramark Uniform and Career Apparel, Inc.\n     Currently, the City has a contract with Aramark Uniform and Career Apparel, Inc. to provide the Public\n     Works Department's professional uniform lease and rental, shop towel rental and cleaning services.\n     The contract was approved via Ordinance 3842 in 2018 and is set to expire August 23, 2023. Currently\n     the City spends approximately $1 00-$150/month for these services and the rates have not increased\n     since the initial term in 2018.\n\n     At this time, Staff is seeking direction from the Board if they would like Staff to put out a formal RFP\n     for vendors to provide quotes for these services or if the Board would like to negotiate with Aramark\n     for another term. Per Aramark, they are willing to keep the existing rates the same for another three (3)\n     years and will allow the City to renew annually.\n\n     Aldennan Maserang inquired if employees are required to utilize this service and if not how many\n     employees utilize the service. Public Works Director Dan Howard replied they are not required and\n\n                                                                                   7\n                                                              Board ofAldermen Committee Meeting,\n                                                                             May4, 2023\n\f\n         approximately half(1/2) ofthe department take advantage of the unifonn pants and City is only charged\n         for the number of uniform pants provided and they provide shop towels. Alderman Huels inquired if\n         he was happy with their service. Public Works Director Dan Howard replied yes.\n\n         Alderman                 Wisbrock                made           a     motion            to      forward            to      the      May          Board           of Aldermen                     meeting             the\n         consideration of an extension to the contract with Aramark Unifonn and Career Apparel, Inc.

With the partnership with\n          the YMCA in July 2022, the YMCA purchased a new auto scrubber to keep in line with equipment\n          they were familiar with from other facilities. There are a couple of known issues with the City's auto\n          scrubber which could easily be repaired, but with the City not having a use for this size of machine at\n          other City facilities it is best to surplus at this point to receive the best price. Staff does have a buyer\n          interested in purchasing at a price higher than the dealer is willing to give the City and is aware of the\n          issues with the auto scrubber.\n\n          Alderman Clauss made a final motion to approve request to surplus an auto scrubber. The motion was\n          seconded by Alderman Wisbrock. Upon a vote being taken,                             it was announced that the motion was\n          passed unanimously by the Board of Aldermen.\n\n    EXECUTIVE SESSION\n    At 8:31 p.m. Alderman Huels made a motion to enter into Executive Session pursuant to Section 610.021\n    ( 1) Legal actions, causes of action or litigation, (I 2) Sealed bids and related documents, until the bids are\n    opened; and sealed proposals and related documents or any documents related to a negotiated contract until\n    a contract is executed, or all proposals are rejected, and ( 19) Existing Or Proposed Security Systems And\n    Structural Plans Of Real Property Owned Or Leased By A Public Governmental Body, And Information\n    That Is Voluntarily Submitted By A Nonpublic Entity Owning Or Operating An Infrastructure To Any\n    Public Governmental Body For Use By That Body To Devise Plans For Protection Of That Infrastructure,\n    The Public Disclosure Of Which Would Threaten Public Safety.

Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC) recently restocked Westside Park lake, and MDC noted it is normal that a few fish may die in the process. MDC further suggested that the muskrats be removed from the lake.\n\nPUBLIC COMMENTS\nThere were no public comments.\n\nPOLICE/MUNICIPAL COURTS - (Clauss, Cruts, Harrell, Jokerst)\nElection of the Committee Chairperson.\n\nAlderman Jokerst made a motion to appoint Alderman Clauss. The motion was seconded by Alderman Harrell. Upon a vote being taken, it was announced that the motion was unanimously passed by the Committee.\n\nConsideration of a request to purchase a water fountain/bottle filling station for the Fenton Precinct.\nThe Fenton Precinct is requesting a new water fountain/bottle filling station to replace the existing water fountain within the Fenton Precinct station.\n\nA request was made to repair the existing water fountain due to the lack of or no water pressure making the fountain not usable. Repair for this fountain will be approximately $100 for parts that are on back order, then labor time for the repair.\n\nA new fountain water filling station costs range from $1,000 to $1,300. It would make sense to be more eco-friendly by installing a bottle filling station and putting any funds towards a new fountain rather than repairing the outdated existing fountain.\n\nAlderman Jokerst expressed she likes the bottle-filling station suggestion and inquired if there were other fountains that need to be replaced in other areas. Mayor Maurath reaffirmed the request on the agenda is a request to repair or replace the fountain for the precinct station and noted there was a kitchen within the precinct where bottles could be filled. Alderman Wisbrock clarified if the fountain under consideration was in the City Hall lobby or in the precinct. Alderman Clauss replied it was the fountain within the precinct station.\n\nCity Administrator Nikki Finkbiner suggested replacing the water fountain in the City Hall lobby with a new fountain/bottle filling station as it would be better utilized by the public and Staff and repair the fountain in the precinct station. Alderman Wisbrock and Alderman Jokerst expressed they would be in favor of her suggestion.\n\nFollowing discussion, Alderman Clauss made a motion to forward to the May Board of Aldermen meeting the consideration of a request to purchase a water fountain/bottle filling station for the City Hall lobby and repair the water fountain in the Fenton Precinct. The motion was seconded by Alderman Harrell. Upon a vote being taken, it was announced that the motion was unanimously passed by the Committee.\n\nConsideration of a request by the Emergency Operations Center to utilize an open space in the Community Development Building if needed during an emergency.\nThe St. Louis County Emergency Operations Center (EOC) is requesting to use an open space in the Community Development Department (former Library space) as needed in the event of an emergency.\n\nPer the EOC, the existing tables, chairs, and power within the space are adequate for their needs, but if needed they would be able to provide additional amenities for the operations.\n\nThe proposed temporary location would not have an impact on the separate/secured office space utilized by the Missouri Highway Patrol or the Community Development Department.\n\nAlderman Clauss made a motion to approve consideration of a request by the EOC to utilize an open space in the Community Development Building if needed during an emergency. The motion was seconded by Alderman Jokerst.\n\nAlderman Jokerst inquired if a generator would be needed. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner replied no they would provide additional amenities needed for the operations.\n\nCaptain Lawson explained the EOC is requesting this location as they may not always have authorized access to their current backup location.\n\nAlderman Maserang inquired if this would conflict with State Highway usage. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner replied, no.\n\nFollowing discussion, the motion was unanimously approved by the Committee.\n\nFollowing further discussion, Alderman Clauss made a motion to open the topic to the full Board. The motion was seconded by Alderman Jokerst. Upon a vote being taken, it was announced that the motion was unanimously passed by the Committee.\n\nAlderman Clauss made a final motion to approve consideration of a request by the EOC to utilize an open space in the Community Development Building if needed during an emergency. The motion was seconded by Alderman Jokerst. Upon a vote being taken, it was announced that the motion was unanimously passed by the Board of Aldermen.\n\nPERSONNEL - (Wisbrock, Cruts, Huels, Jokerst)\nElection of the Committee Chairperson.\n\nAlderman Jokerst made a motion to appoint Alderman Huels. The motion was seconded by Alderman Wisbrock. Upon a vote being taken, it was announced that the motion was unanimously passed by the Committee.\n\nCOMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND AFFAIRS - (Bereitschaft, Harrell, Clauss, Maserang)\nElection of the Committee Chairperson.\n\nAlderman Maserang made a motion to appoint Alderman Bereitschaft. The motion was seconded by Alderman Harrell. Upon a vote being taken, it was announced that the motion was unanimously passed by the Committee.\n\nConsideration of a request by Francis Energy for the City to apply for a Charging and Fueling Infrastructure (CFI) Grant for EV's at Wally's.\nThe Charging and Fueling Infrastructure (CFI) Grant Program has made available $700 million dollars from FY2022 and FY2023 to strategically deploy electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure across the country, particularly in urban, rural, and disadvantaged communities. Private entities such as Wally's and Francis Energy are not eligible applicants, but municipalities such as the City of Fenton are. The CFI grant requires an 80/20 cost share. If this project were to be awarded, Francis Energy would provide the 20% match. The application for this round of funding is due on May 30, 2023, and Francis Energy is prepared to provide grant writing support.\n\nWally's proposes that the City of Fenton submit an application to upgrade the existing Francis Energy infrastructure at Wally's Fenton located at 950 Assembly Parkway, Fenton, MO 63026. There are currently two 60kW charging ports that can charge two cars simultaneously. This project will upgrade the station capacity to charge at least four (4) cars simultaneously at 150kWh each, meeting the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Standards. Seeing that Wally's is conveniently located near the intersection of I-44 and I-270, this location could serve the citizens of Fenton while also drawing interstate travelers into the City of Fenton and nearby various local businesses. Francis Energy is also open to including other interested site hosts, public or private, on this application.\n\nAlderman Jokerst asked for clarification if the request is for City status to obtain grant funding for a private company. Mayor Maurath shared the City would need to apply for the grant, if approved it is an 80/20 cost share that Francis Energy would pay the 20% match.\n\nMatt Jones, Francis Energy was present via videoconference. Mr. Jones shared they would like to partner with the City for the CFI grant funding. The first round of funding offers up to $700 million in 2022-2023. The grant will fund up to 80% of the cost of building charging infrastructure and as a partnership with the City, they would provide the 20% match cost as the municipality is eligible to apply for the grant and they are not. They built the current 60kW charge system at Wally's in 2022. They could upgrade that into four (4) 150kW system.\n\nAlderman Clauss inquired why the City should consider applying for a grant for a private entity instead of the City applying for and installing the charging system themselves.\n\nMr. Jones shared the consideration could be for other areas beyond Wally's location. There are two (2) types of grants: (L3) Corridor Charging Grants, to be used along state-designated corridors, and (L2) Community Charging Grants, to install EV charging in public places such as schools, grocery stores, parks, libraries, or multi-family sites and must be publicly accessible.\n\nAlderman Bereitschaft expressed he feels Fenton residents would not benefit with a charging station as they would utilize their own system at their home and inquired if the City applied for the grant how the financial process transpires. Mr. Jones replied 80-90% of charging does take place at home, but there is a benefit to attract people off a major corridor that will also shop and eat at the local business. Mr. Jones explained the City receives the funding and is dispersed for approved projects outlined in the grant.\n\nAlderman Maserang inquired if the consideration is driven by current demand or anticipated demand and further inquired if City received funding would it hinder eligibility for future grants for the City. Mr. Jones shared EV sales are increasing but there are also reservations due to range anxiety of available charging systems to get from point A to point B. This is an investment to reduce the range anxiety. He assumes the City would be eligible to apply for any round of funding.\n\nAlderman Jokerst shared she would like to consider additional charging locations within the City. She further inquired if revenues generated would be 100% to Francis Energy or would it be split with the City. Mr. Jones explained they typically have ground leases, flat rate, or an agreed percentage whichever is higher, and Francis Energy would own, operate, upgrade, and maintain the system.\n\nCity Attorney Erin Seele inquired about grant agreement terms the City would need to consider. Mr. Jones shared it is a five (5) year agreement, outlining liability, operations, maintenance, and reporting responsibility and he would provide a copy of the agreement terms for review. If the grant would be approved, the project would require a Request for Proposals (RFP) of which they would submit a proposal for the project, that can be run concurrently with the grant application. Mr. Jones reminded the Board the deadline to submit the grant is May 30, 2023.\n\nCity Administrator Nikki Finkbiner asked Mr. Jones to explain where the funding came from. Mr. Jones explained the U.S. Department of Transportation's new CFI grant program, was established by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed in 2021, that will provide Federal funds of $2.5 billion over five (5) years to applicants from cities, counties, local governments, and Tribes.\n\nAlderman Clauss expressed she feels if a charging station would be installed at City Hall or other City property it could benefit City employees that would need to charge their vehicles.\n\nAlderman Huels inquired if additional locations would be considered at this time, would it slow down the submittal process of this request with the May 30th deadline. Mr. Jones replied he did not believe it would and shared they would help with the additional request to the extent the procurement laws would allow.\n\nAlderman Wisbrock asked how many charging stations are currently at Wally's. Mr. Jones replied currently there are two (2) 60kW charging stations. Alderman Wisbrock expressed he feels additional locations would better serve public access in locations close to roadways, gas stations, shopping centers rather than parks, RiverChase YMCA, or City Hall and feels that if located on City property after the five (5) year agreement is expired the City will not be able to maintain the infrastructure as needed. Mr. Jones explained the federal funding will help provide maintenance for the first five (5) years and typically leases run fifteen to twenty (15-20) years, however as Francis Energy would be the owner/operator, they would continue maintenance and liability for the life of the infrastructure.\n\nCity Administrator Nikki Finkbiner inquired if this was the only submission opportunity for this grant or if additional applications for other locations could be submitted annually. Mr. Jones replied the first two (2) fiscal years have been combined into this application, however, there will be three (3) more fiscal years to submit future applications and believes they will be more difficult and competitive the longer the program is open. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner further inquired if Francis Energy sought out other locations within Fenton for consideration to make this application more robust. Mr. Jones stated he would verify with their acquisition team if there were other leases for consideration in the area. Typically, they take the lead from the community for location sites.\n\nKevin Herdler, Executive Director, St. Louis Regional Clean Cities was present at the meeting. Mr. Herdler stated he would be available to assist the City if there would be consideration of additional applications in the future. He further explained, the Corridor Grant they are requesting allows them to connect Oklahoma and Missouri as a Route 66 electric highway and the program wants the higher charging stations on these roadways approximately each one hundred fifty (150) miles. If moved forward, this would be the first National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) in Missouri.\n\nMayor Maurath shared he feels more consideration needs to be given before moving forward and further inquired how would the City receive revenue from the charging station as it is not City property. Mr. Herdler explained through utility tax revenue.\n\nCity Administrator Nikki Finkbiner asked if there was an agreement outlining liabilities, maintenance, payment, etc., that can be reviewed, and noted that the City could be required to have a single audit completed if this grant was awarded and track both revenue and expenses of the grant. Mr. Jones shared Francis Energy would pay the expenses for the construction of the project and submit requests for reimbursement to the City up to the 80% cost. Mayor Maurath inquired about safeguards for financial liability. Mr. Jones stated there are required construction bonds that would be in place.\n\nAfter discussion, Alderman Bereitschaft made a motion to forward to the May Board of Aldermen meeting the consideration of the request by Francis Energy for the City to apply for a Charging and Fueling Infrastructure (CFI) Grant for EV's at Wally's and have City Attorney review terms in the agreement.

Alderman Huels shared her concern is that it is not the role of Chairperson to oversee projects or get deeply involved in the daily operations of the department, the role is reporting to the Board. Alderman Maserang agreed. Mayor Maurath shared he feels the Chairperson has a total understanding of focus and issues within the committee and communications with the Staff and committee.\n\nUpon a vote being taken, it was announced that the motion was unanimously passed by the Committee.\n\nConsideration of bids for the 2023 Bud Weil Park Roof Replacement Project.\nThe City held the bid opening for the 2023 Bud Weil Park Roof Replacement Project on April 27, 2023, at 10:00 a.m. Two (2) bids were submitted for consideration: Jeffco Guttering and Allen Roofing and Siding.\n\nWith the unit pricing provided by both bidders to replace the roofs with architectural asphalt shingles, Jeffco Guttering submitted the lowest responsive bid of $17,683.00.

The option is for comparison. Public Works Director Dan Howard expressed he is in favor of shingles for aesthetics and history of Bud Weil Park.\n\nAlderman Bereitschaft inquired if metal vs. shingle would affect insurance cost. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner replied no.\n\nMayor Maurath inquired about the bone structure of the buildings.

There are a couple of known issues with the City's auto scrubber which could easily be repaired, but with the City not having use for this size of machine at other City facilities, it is best to surplus at this point to receive the best price.
