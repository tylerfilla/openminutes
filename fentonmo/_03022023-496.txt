•    Discussion regarding repairs to the outdoor pool at RiverChase YMCA.
     A proposal from Midwest Pool and Court Co. notes certain maintenance and repair items are needed
     at the outdoor pools at RiverChase YMCA before opening for the summer season. As indicated in the
     quote, a six to eight (6-8) week lead time is needed for delivery ifnew pool pumps are required.

     Per the      operation      and   management          agreement       with    the   YMCA,        any    repairs,    maintenance,        and
     improvements to           the building/amenities at RiverChase                    YMCA that          are $5,000       or more are        the
     responsibility of the City.

     Funds needed/anticipated for repairs to the pools at RiverChase YMCA were included in the 2023
     Budget under the Capital Fund in the amount of $100,000.

     Based on the above, Staff is seeking permission to move forward with the needed maintenance and
     repairs provided in the quote. Staff is also requesting that the Board consider entering into an on-call,
     as-needed maintenance and repair agreement with Midwest Pool and Court for these repairs and any
     future maintenance/repairs.

     The YMCA currently utilizes Midwest Pool and Court for maintenance and repairs of their pools and
     aquatic amenities at their other branches. The YMCA has also used Midwest Pool and Court for some
     repairs at RiverChase YMCA, as allowed by the contract. Other than Midwest Pool and Court and
     Westport Pools (in which the City also has a contract with for on-call, as-needed services), there are
     limited    companies        locally that can         provide these        maintenance        and    repair   services. Having          both
     companies under contract with the City would be very beneficial.

     Public Works Director Dan Howard shared the YMCA is working with Midwest Pool and Court to
     repair the pool heater.

     Alderman Wisbrock suggested as the current pumps are twenty-two (22) years old, would                                                 it be
     beneficial to order a spare pump for backup. Public Works Director Dan Howard shared only one (I)
     of the current pumps has had impellor replacement and a few minor mechanisms over the years. If
     rebuilding the current pump was recommended, the cost would be approximately $7,000 worst case
     scenario or replace with new pump, the approximate cost would be $14,000. Minor repairs to leaks in
    recirculation skimmer body and adjoining concrete will also be evaluated. Replace failed drain valve
    on Leisure Pool sump drain at cost of $2,985.00. It was noted additional damage may have occurred
    over winter and is not covered by this quote.

    Mayor Maurath suggested he feels the need to investigate the condition of pumps first. Alderman
    Cruts expressed he feels buying a new pump would be beneficial due to age of pumps.

    Alderman Huels made a motion to have Staff work with Midwest Pool and Court for consideration of
    repair or replacement of pumps                   in accordance with the proposal. The motion was seconded by
    Alderman        Jokerst.     Upon      a   vote    being     taken,    it was      announced        that   the   motion      was     passed
    unanimously by the Board of Aldermen.
