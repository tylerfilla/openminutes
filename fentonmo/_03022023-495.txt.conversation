If\n     not, what is the purpose of increasing the tax burden on the residents of Fenton?\"\n\n     City Attorney Erin Seele explained if City passed the use tax, RSMo. 144.759 (I) there would be no\n     redistribution of money. Whereas, if County would pass the use tax, RSMo. 144.759 (2) the County\n     would redistribute a portion of the use tax to municipalities based on population.\n\n     Alderman Maserang inquired if both City and County had the proposition on the ballot and both passed\n     the tax would the City collect both.
