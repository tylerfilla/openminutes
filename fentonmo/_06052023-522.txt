         During the February 6                                  Meeting, the Parks and Recreation Committee requested that Staff gather
         additional infonnation regarding options for a restroom at Fabick Nature Preserve, specifically a cost
         estimate for a pre-fabricated structure.

         Due to difficulties obtaining estimates to remodel the existing building,                                                                                              the Board of Aldermen

         Committee in July.

NEW BUSINESS:
•       Discussion regarding Municipal Parks Grant Commission Planning Grant.
         As recommended by the Committee and approved by the Board, Staff has begun applying for the
         Municipal Park                       Grant Commission Planning Grant for                                                        a Master               Plan for            the       Bud         Weil        Annex
         Property as it is undeveloped.

        As a reminder, the application for the grant is revolving throughout the year (no deadline); however,
        the maximum funding available per project is $10,000, with the City providing a minimum 20% cost-
         share. In order to apply for the grant, the City must have selected a planning firm with a quote and
         scope of services to provide planning services to develop the Master Plan.

        Based on the above, a Request For Proposals for Park Planning Services was advertised by the City in
                                                                                                                                      st
         early May, with a deadline to submit proposals by May 31                                                                        .

        The proposals were received by the following planning firms:                                                                               Gateway Design Studio, LLC, TWM,
         Inc., Planning Design Studios, and SWT Design and were available for review. At this time, it                                                                                                                           is
        requested that the Parks and Recreation Committee review the proposals to assist in selecting a firm
        for the planning project and make a recommendation to the Board of Aldermen.

        City         Administrator Nikki                            Finkbiner shared                         in    2020 the               Committee reviewed                               planning firms for
        Comprehensive Park Plan project and                                                       Planning Design Studios was selected                                                     by      the Committee,
        however the project was not moved forward. In 2002 the City used SWT Design for a Comprehensive
        Park Master Plan that was never adopted. Gateway Design Studio, LLC, TWM, Inc. also appear to
        have good qualifications. Once a selection is made, negogiations could occur regarding final                                                                                                                      costs
        and        scope          of work               and        presented              to     the       Board           for final             approval              for      a    contract that                  will        be
         incorporated into the grant

        Mary Heinemann inquired on the Board of Aldermens support and commitment to impleminting a
        Master Plan for the Bud                                    Weil Annex Property if Committee makes                                                             recommendation                         to    move it
        forward, as the 2002 Comprehensive Park Master Plan was not adopted or implemented. Alderman
        Huels expressed she would pose the question to the Board and further advised the Committee on
        development limitations for the Bud Weil Annex Propery as there are no water or sewer lines, the
        lake, connections to Fabick Nature Preserve and a large area of steep hill. City Administrator Nikki
        Finkbiner further shared the City purchased the Bud Weil Annex Property in 2014 property is not
        deed restricted, it was purchased mainly to provide access points to the Fabick Nature Preserve as the
        Fabick property is deed restricted.

        After discussion, Chairman Johnson suggested topic was continued to the July meeting to allow the
        Committee time to review proposals for selection. There were no objections.

•       Discussion regarding Municipal Parks Grant Commission Construction Grant.

                                                                                                                 2
                                                                                  Parks and Recreation Committee Meeting
                                                                                                        June 5, 2023

     As discussed with the Committee earlier this year, the Municipal Park Grant Commission opened the
     next round of funding for a Construction Grant on June 15\ with a deadline of August 28, 2023.

    This grant can be used for park renovations including: playgrounds, water parks, golf courses, trails,
    recreation centers, ice rinks, etc. No cost match required, but an extra point for 5% match can be
    obtained within the grant.      The maximum award is population based at $315,000.                The City has been
    awarded 3.3 grants in the past (partial award due to the collaborative 1-44 Bridge Greenway grant
    with Kirkwood and Sunset Hills) at a total award amount of $437,595.                     As an example, the Olde
    Towne Pavilion was constructed with funding awarded under the Construction Grant.

    It is noted that the purpose of the competitive grant is to fund projects that would not otherwise be
    implemented without the funding; therefore, a project selected for the grant cannot be listed in the
    City's Capital Plan that was available for review.

    Based on the above, and noting that time is of the essence do to the application deadline, if the
    Committee would like for the City to apply for funding, a project will need to be selected as soon as
    possible.   To   assist   in selecting   a   project, the    most   recent   published    annual   report   from   the
    Commission outlining projects that were funded under Round 22 in 2021 was available for review.

    Audrey Wattler suggested Meramec Greenway trail connection. Mary Heinemann suggested waiting
    until next year to      allow time    to review    Bud    Weil Annex      Plan   if approved.    Chairman Johnson
    suggested parking and restrooms near the Olde Towne Pavilion.

    After discussion, Chairman Johson suggested the topic be continued to next year to allow project
    selection. There were no objections.

•   Discussion regarding Missouri Department of Conservation Community Forestry Cost Share
    Program.
    Staff has contacted the Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC) regarding funding under the
    Community Forestry Cost Share Program.                Noting that the City already provides funding for the
    removal of dead and diseased trees under the Capital Plan, it was suggested that the City consider
    applying for funding under the Forestry Program to hire a                 professional service to provide a tree
    inventory.    The tree inventory will assist the City with identifying and prioritizing trees that need to
    be removed due to disease and/or decay or due to the invasive nature of the tree.                  Additionally, the
    tree inventory is usually completed within an asset management database or GIS format that is then
    provided to the City upon completion of the survey so that progress can be easily tracked.

    Per MDC, the requests for the next round of funding under the Community Forestry Cost Share
    Program will begin on July 1, 2023.            It is noted that applicants that apply at the beginning of the
    funding round have a better opportunity of receiving funding.

    The maximum funding allowed under an application is $49,000 per year, with a 50/50 cost share
    (example: if awarded $49,000 by MDC, the City must provide $49,000 in cash or in-kind services
    toward the project).      However, due to the number of applications received by MDC, it is suggested
    that the application have a max request of $25,000 to be more competitive (likely to receive funding).

    Per MDC, quotes will         also need to be obtained from         a professional contractor that provides tree
    inventory services and provided with the request for funding.

     Based on the above, should the Committee desire that staff apply for funding under the Community
     Forestry Cost Share Program for a tree inventory of public trees, a recommendation regarding the
     same will need to be forwarded to the Board of Aldermen.

     After discussion, Mary Heinemann made a motion to recommend applying for funding under the
     Missouri Department of Conservation Community Forestry Cost Share Program for a tree inventory
     of public trees. Audrey Wattler seconded the motion.

          5 Ayes; 0 Nays, 2 Absent, 0 Abstain:           Motion APPROVED by voice vote.

•    Discussion      regarding       Missouri      Department        of   Conservation        Community         Conservation
     Assistance Program.
     As requested by the Committee, Staff contact MDC to discuss funding options to implement the
     Master Park Plan for Fabick Nature Preserve.               Per MDC, the recommendation is that the City start
     with   applying     for invasive     specifies   control,    specifically   honeysuckle,      within    the park    before
     submitting for other project funding.

     Per MDC, the best funding opportunity for invasive species control will be under the Community
     Conservation Assistances Program and MDC will                    begin accepting requests for the next round of
     funding under this program on July 1, 2023.               Applicants that apply at the beginning of the funding
     round have a better opportunity of receiving funding.

     The maximum funding allowed under an application is $49,000 per year, with a 50/50 cost share
     (example: if awarded $49,000 by MDC, the City must provide $49,000 in cash or in-kind services
     toward the project).        The project application will consist of the City requesting funding to hire a
     professional service to remove the invasive species in areas identified within the proposed scope of
     work.

     Staff can work with MDC to identify areas that need invasive control and will assist in prioritizing the
     areas before the application is submitted; however, due to the extensive invasion in the park, requests
     for funds will most likely need to occur over multiple grant rounds.

     Per   MDC,     quotes    will also    need   to be    obtained    from    a professional     ecological/environmental
     contractor that provides        invasive   species    management services,         along with the areas        of priority
     identified, within the request for funding.

     Based on the above, should the Committee desire that staff apply for funding under the Community
     Conservation      Assistance     Program     for   invasive    species   removal     in Fabick     Nature     Preserve,    a
     recommendation regarding the same will need to be forwarded to the Board of Aldermen.

     After discussion, Mary Heinemann made a motion to recommend applying for funding under the
     Missouri Department of Conservation Community Conservation Assistance                            Program for      invasive
     specifies control, specifically honeysuckle. Audrey Wattler seconded the motion.

          5 Ayes; 0 Nays, 2 Absent, 0 Abstain:           Motion APPROVED by voice vote.
