Public Works Director Dan Howard shared only one (I)\n     of the current pumps has had impellor replacement and a few minor mechanisms over the years. If\n     rebuilding the current pump was recommended, the cost would be approximately $7,000 worst case\n     scenario or replace with new pump, the approximate cost would be $14,000. Minor repairs to leaks in\n    recirculation skimmer body and adjoining concrete will also be evaluated. Replace failed drain valve\n    on Leisure Pool sump drain at cost of $2,985.00. It was noted additional damage may have occurred\n    over winter and is not covered by this quote.\n\n    Mayor Maurath suggested he feels the need to investigate the condition of pumps first. Alderman\n    Cruts expressed he feels buying a new pump would be beneficial due to age of pumps.\n\n    Alderman Huels made a motion to have Staff work with Midwest Pool and Court for consideration of\n    repair or replacement of pumps                   in accordance with the proposal.
