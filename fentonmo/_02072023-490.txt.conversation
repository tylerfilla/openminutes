A    copy       of the       PowerPoint\n                  presentation is           attached for         the record and copies of corresponding documents provided to the\n                  Commission are on file with the Community Development Department.\n\n                  Director Starck explained that Staff is proposing a change to the fom1at                                                   of the Comprehensive\n                  Plan, away from the current version designed as a road map as it is difficult to reproduce, to a\n                  more      customary           docmnent          format.       Additionally,           Staff has        proposed         an    Introduction           section\n                  divided into an Overview, detailing relevant history and demographics of the City, and Purpose,\n                  providing overall objectives of the Plan and presenting the six Planning Areas as discussed at the\n                  November 2022 Workshop.\n\n                  Discussion ensued regarding the first three Planning Areas - Public and Governmental, Parks and\n                 Recreation,           and    Residential.          Director       Starck       described        how      the    draft     of each Planning               Area\n                  included an Overview, Goals, and Objectives adding that Staff was careful to uphold the original\n                  intent and directives of the 1997 Comprehensive Plan while amending those parts that no longer\n                  serve the City. Noted changes from the 1997 Plan are detailed in the footnote to each Planning\n                 Area.      She added that a map was also provided for each Planning Area with attention to                                                              those\n                 areas where future rezoning may be considered.\n\n                 Additional discussion was held regarding the importance of environmentally sensitive areas and\n                 the City's desire to protect those areas through floodplain regulations and other flood mitigation\n                 measures, preservation of wooded areas,                                and the        encouragement of large-lot developments or\n                 Planned Unit Developments in residential areas.                                    She noted that these environmentally sensitive\n                 areas are generally characterized by steep slopes; watershed, drainage courses, floodplains and\n                 other water features; shallow soils; wooded areas; and wildlife habitats. Maps were prepared and\n                 provided to the Commission related to these topics for discussion.                                               Mayor Maurath noted for the\n                 records that around a 1/3 of the City's parks are in floodplain.\n\n                 Following discussion, Chairperson Yeoman called an additional workshop session at 6:00 p.m. in\n                 advance of the April 5, 2023 meeting to discuss amendments to the remaining Planning Areas of\n                 the Comprehensive Plan.\n\n     ADJOURNMENT:                        7:03 p.m.\n\n                 A motion to adjourn was made by Chairperson Yeoman and seconded by Commissioner Glover\n                 The motion was unanimously approved by voice vote.\n\n                 Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n\n            ~AA(\n                       y St    r                                                                       Ke                                       rperson\n                 Community Development Director                                                        Plan                               Commission\n                                                                                                                   O\n\f\nCity of Fenton\n\nComprehensive\n\nPlan\nWORKSHOP\n\f\nIntroduction\n\n\n\n\n1.

A copy of the PowerPoint presentation is attached for the record, and copies of corresponding documents provided to the Commission are on file with the Community Development Department.\n\nDirector Starck explained that Staff is proposing a change to the format of the Comprehensive Plan, away from the current version designed as a roadmap as it is difficult to reproduce, to a more customary document format. Additionally, Staff has proposed an Introduction section divided into an Overview, detailing relevant history and demographics of the City, and Purpose, providing overall objectives of the Plan and presenting the six Planning Areas as discussed at the November 2022 Workshop.\n\nDiscussion ensued regarding the first three Planning Areas - Public and Governmental, Parks and Recreation, and Residential. Director Starck described how the draft of each Planning Area included an Overview, Goals, and Objectives adding that Staff was careful to uphold the original intent and directives of the 1997 Comprehensive Plan while amending those parts that no longer serve the City. Noted changes from the 1997 Plan are detailed in the footnote to each Planning Area. She added that a map was also provided for each Planning Area with attention to those areas where future rezoning may be considered.\n\nAdditional discussion was held regarding the importance of environmentally sensitive areas and the City's desire to protect those areas through floodplain regulations and other flood mitigation measures, preservation of wooded areas, and the encouragement of large-lot developments or Planned Unit Developments in residential areas. She noted that these environmentally sensitive areas are generally characterized by steep slopes; watershed, drainage courses, floodplains and other water features; shallow soils; wooded areas; and wildlife habitats. Maps were prepared and provided to the Commission related to these topics for discussion. Mayor Maurath noted for the records that around a 1/3 of the City's parks are in floodplain.\n\nFollowing discussion, Chairperson Yeoman called an additional workshop session at 6:00 p.m. in advance of the April 5, 2023 meeting to discuss amendments to the remaining Planning Areas of the Comprehensive Plan.\n\nADJOURNMENT: 7:03 p.m.\n\nA motion to adjourn was made by Chairperson Yeoman and seconded by Commissioner Glover. The motion was unanimously approved by voice vote.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nAmy Starck\nCommunity Development Director\nCallan Yeoman\nChairperson\nPlanning & Zoning Commission\n\nCity of Fenton\n\nComprehensive Plan WORKSHOP\n\nIntroduction\n\n1.
