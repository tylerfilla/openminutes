A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department. She\n                explained that the Petitioner is seeking to locate a Medical Office providing behavioral health services\n                in an existing building in the \"HP-1\" District. As a Medical Office is not a permitted use in \"HP-I\",\n               the Petitioner is proposing to amend the Land Use Matrix to allow the use as a Special Use Permit in\n               conjunction with the next item on the agenda, Case 2023-SUP-04.                                      Community Development D1rector\n               Amy Starck read the purpose of the \"HP-1\" District to the Commission.                                             It was discussed that this\n               amendment would affect the entire \"HP-1\" District, not just the specific site, and how such did not\n               seem to meet the purpose of the district.\n\n               The     Petitioners,        Katrina      McDonald           Fuller      and     Quincy       McCoy,        approached.          The     Petitioners\n               summarized their proposed use and explained the reason they chose to locate in the \"HP-I\" District is\n               because it is centrally located with high visibility. The Commission discussed that while there is a\n               need for mental health services, there are many other districts that allow Medical Offices. It was stated\n               that the Commission has                 considered carefully the               uses within the Land Use Matrix over the past\n               several years and feel the most appropriate uses for this district are those that support hospitality. In\n              her absence, Commissioner Nelson provided the Commission with a letter in opposition to the Text\n              Amendment.            Vice    Chairperson         Sherrel      read    the   letter aloud       to   those     in attendance. The            letter   is\n              attached to minutes for the record.\n\n              The     property       owner,      David      Kulaski,       approached.         Discussion        was     held    regarding       the   difference\n              between Medical Office and Medical Facility, which is permitted by                                           SUP in the district. Director\n              Starck provided definitions for both uses and explained that Medical Facilities are more intensive uses\n              such as      diagnostic        centers,     laboratories,       and    urgent care facilities.            Based on the          information and\n              statements provided by the applicant, the proposed use falls under the definition of a Medical Office.\n\n              Following discussion, Commissioner Wisbrock made a motion to APPROVE CASE 2023-TXT-\n              02. Alderman Harrell seconded the motion.\n\n             Roll Call:\n             Chairperson Callan Yeoman                                  Absent\n             Vice-Chairperson Kevin Sherrel                             Nays\n             Secretary Deborah Abbott                                   Nays\n             Commissioner Bill Voorhees                                 Nays\n             Commissioner Warren Wisbrock                               Nays\n             Commissioner Bill Glover                                   Absent\n             Commissioner Linda Nelson                                  Absent\n             Commissioner John Bielicki                                 Absent\n             Alderman Ron Harrell                                       Nays\n             Mayor Joe Maurath                                         Nays\n\n             0 Ayes; 6 Nays; 4 Absent:                  Motion DENIED\n\f\nPlanning and Zoning Commission Meeting                                                                                                         Page4\nMarch 7, 2023\n\n                 CASE 2023-SUP-04: A Petition by Compass Health Network for a Special Use Permit to operate\n                 a Medical Office at 964 South Highway Drive. The property is zoned \"HP-1\" Hospitality Park\n                 District.\n\n                City Attorney Erin Seele reminded the Commission that even                                         though the        Text Amendment was\n                denied, the Commission should evaluate this request based on the criteria for issuing a SUP set by the\n                Code.\n\n                Community           Development           Director       Amy       Starck      gave     a   summary         of the      Staff     report     to   the\n                Commission. A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department. She\n                explained that the proposed                 Medical       Office will        offer behavior health services within the 9,711-\n                square-foot tenant space. Staff reviewed the required parking for the existing uses on the parcel as\n                well as the proposed Medical Office. Based on the information provided by the Petitioner regarding\n               the number of staff members on-site over the course of the day, the minimum parking can be met. The\n               petitioner explained that staff would be going out into the community for case management and would\n               use this location as a hub to make phone calls, answer emails, and other similar tasks. Additionally,\n               there may also be IO to 15 patients on site to learn daily living skills at this location.\n\n               Following        the    discussion,       Vice     Chairperson         Sherrel     read     aloud     the   conditions       of approval.        The\n               Petitioner agreed to all.\n\n               Conditions of Approval:\n                     1.   This Special Use Permit is solely for Compass Health Network, to operate a Medical Office at\n                          964 South Highway Drive.\n                     2.

Staffs original recommendation was based on those districts that allowed Medical\n               Marijuana Dispensaries and those that allow similar retail uses (liquor stores). Based on this, Staff\n               does not recommend expanding Marijuana Dispensaries in any additional districts at this time.\n\n               Mayor Maurath, stated for the record that while he did vote to approve the recommendation to only\n               include dispensaries in \"C-1\" at the January Commission meeting, after considering the characteristics\n               of the     districts     more     and    listening      to   further     discussion,       he   feels    \"HP-I\" and          \"OT-2\"       are   also\n              appropriate locations for dispensaries.

A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department. She explained that the Petitioner is proposing two Wall Signs, one on the front fa\u00e7ade and one on the rear fa\u00e7ade, for America's Best Contacts and Eyeglasses in Gravois Bluffs. The front Wall Sign will exceed the 5% allowed when wall signs are proposed on more than one facade, but the rear sign will not.

A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department. She explained that the Petitioner is seeking to locate a Medical Office providing behavioral health services in an existing building in the \"HP-1\" District. As a Medical Office is not a permitted use in \"HP-1\", the Petitioner is proposing to amend the Land Use Matrix to allow the use as a Special Use Permit in conjunction with the next item on the agenda, Case 2023-SUP-04. Community Development Director Amy Starck read the purpose of the \"HP-1\" District to the Commission. It was discussed that this amendment would affect the entire \"HP-1\" District, not just the specific site, and how such did not seem to meet the purpose of the district.\n\nThe Petitioners, Katrina McDonald Fuller and Quincy McCoy, approached. The Petitioners summarized their proposed use and explained the reason they chose to locate in the \"HP-1\" District is because it is centrally located with high visibility. The Commission discussed that while there is a need for mental health services, there are many other districts that allow Medical Offices. It was stated that the Commission has considered carefully the uses within the Land Use Matrix over the past several years and feel the most appropriate uses for this district are those that support hospitality. In her absence, Commissioner Nelson provided the Commission with a letter in opposition to the Text Amendment. Vice Chairperson Sherrel read the letter aloud to those in attendance. The letter is attached to minutes for the record.\n\nThe property owner, David Kulaski, approached. Discussion was held regarding the difference between Medical Office and Medical Facility, which is permitted by SUP in the district. Director Starck provided definitions for both uses and explained that Medical Facilities are more intensive uses such as diagnostic centers, laboratories, and urgent care facilities. Based on the information and statements provided by the applicant, the proposed use falls under the definition of a Medical Office.\n\nFollowing discussion, Commissioner Wisbrock made a motion to APPROVE CASE 2023-TXT-02.

A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department. She explained that the proposed Medical Office will offer behavior health services within the 9,711-square-foot tenant space. Staff reviewed the required parking for the existing uses on the parcel as well as the proposed Medical Office. Based on the information provided by the Petitioner regarding the number of staff members on-site over the course of the day, the minimum parking can be met. The petitioner explained that staff would be going out into the community for case management and would use this location as a hub to make phone calls, answer emails, and other similar tasks. Additionally, there may also be 10 to 15 patients on site to learn daily living skills at this location.\n\nFollowing the discussion, Vice Chairperson Sherrel read aloud the conditions of approval. The Petitioner agreed to all.\n\nConditions of Approval:\n1. This Special Use Permit is solely for Compass Health Network, to operate a Medical Office at 964 South Highway Drive.\n2. Minimally, an Occupancy Permit will be required before the space is occupied.\n3. Municipal Zoning Approval (MZA) by the City of Fenton and a Building Permit from St. Louis County will be required for any proposed interior remodel.\n4.

Staff's original recommendation was based on those districts that allowed Medical Marijuana Dispensaries and those that allow similar retail uses (liquor stores). Based on this, Staff does not recommend expanding Marijuana Dispensaries in any additional districts at this time.\n\nMayor Maurath stated for the record that while he did vote to approve the recommendation to only include dispensaries in \"C-1\" at the January Commission meeting, after considering the characteristics of the districts more and listening to further discussion, he feels \"HP-1\" and \"OT-2\" are also appropriate locations for dispensaries. He agrees with Staff's determination to not expand at this time.\n\nFollowing additional discussion regarding other districts, Secretary Abbott made a motion to NOT EXPAND Comprehensive Marijuana Dispensary Facilities in additional districts under CASE 2023-TXT-03.
