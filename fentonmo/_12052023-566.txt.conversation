A copy of the PowerPoint presentation is attached for the record and\n            copies   of corresponding    documents    provided   to the Commission      are on   file with   the Community\n            Development Department.\n\n            Director Starck explained that the format of the Comprehensive Plan is proposed away from the \"road\n            map\"    version of the   1997   Comprehensive     Plan   to an easier   booklet format.    She summarized      the\n            Introduction section of the proposed Comprehensive          Plan that is divided into an     Overview, detailing\n            relevant history and demographics of the City, and Purpose, providing overall objectives of the Plan to act\n            as a guide for future development/redevelopment. The Plan is divided into six Planning Areas. Director\n            Starck emphasized that special attention was paid to retaining the overall intent and directives of the 1997\n            Comprehensive Plan.\n\n            Director   Starck briefly   summarized    the six   planning   areas; Public    and Governmental;      Parks and\n            Recreation;   Residential; Olde Towne;     Commercial;     and Business and Industrial.     Each Planning Area\n            provides an Overview, Goals, and Objectives and any notable changes from the 1997 Plan are detailed in\n            the footnotes. She mentioned that, at the direction of the Commission, the Plan identifies large lots within\n            the Residential   Planning   Area   as those   with   a minimum      of one   acre in keeping     with the   1997\n            Comprehensive Pla11. She further remarked that, based on multiple discussions during the workshops, the\n            Commission sought to clarify The Plan and added language to include specifically prohibiting residential\n            uses/developments in     the Commercial     Planning area as   they did not feel    it was in keeping with the\n            character and nature of the Planning Area. Based on the proposed changes, Director Starck commented\n            that Staff will be bringing needed Zoning Code amendments and rezoning requests to the Commission\n            throughout the year.\n\n            Following the presentation, there were no comments from the public or the Commission. Director Starck\n            stated that a resolution to adopt the changes to The Plan would be considered at the December 5, 2023\n            Planning and Zoning Commission meeting to follow the Public Hearing at 7:00 PM.\n\n   ADJOURNMENT:           6:26 p.m.\n\n            A motion to adjourn was made by Commissioner Nelson and seconded by Alderman Harrell.
