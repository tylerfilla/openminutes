                 CASE 2023-SUP-01: A Petition by Best Box MO Gravois, LLC for a Special Use Permit to
                 operate a Self-Storage Facility at 747 Gravois Road. The property is zoned "C-1" Commercial
                District.

                Community            Development           Director       Amy       Starck      gave     a   summary         of    the    Staff    report      to   the
                Commission. A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department. She
                explained that the proposed Self-Storage Facility received approval of a Special Use Permit in June
                and Site Plan Review in October. Most recently, the Board approved a request to rezone the parcel
                addressed        as   743     Gravois       Road      included       in   the   development          plan     in   addition      to   a   Boundary
                Adjustment Plat to combine 743 and 747 Gravois Road. The property was recently purchased by the
                Petitioner       who      intends     to    develop       the   proposed        Self-Storage         Facility     with     no    changes       to   the
                previously        approved        conceptual         design.      She    explained        that,    as   Special      Use     Permits       are    non-
                transferrable, the Petitioner is               seeking a new SUP due to                   a name change but no                other changes are
                proposed        from     what     was previously presented                and     approved.       It was      noted     that   no   comments         or
                concerns had been received by the Community Development Department relative to this request.

                Noting that the Petitioner was not present, Chairperson Yeoman read aloud the conditions of approval
                for the record.

                 CASE 2023-SUP-02: A Petition by Tonja Matthias of First Stop Chiropractic, LLC for a Special
                 Use Permit to operate a Medical Office at 558 Gravois Road, Suite 201. The property is zoned
                 "OT-2" Olde Towne District.

                 Community           Development            Director       Amy       Starck     gave      a   summary          of   the    Staff     report     to    the
                 Commission. A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department. She
                 explained that the proposed Medical Office will offer chiropractic care within the 720-square-foot
                 tenant space.        When queried about the parking, Director Starck stated that lot provided around 50
                 spaces and the required parking for the subject use would be 3 spaces based on the Zoning Code
                 requirements. In looking at the existing uses within the building, around 39 spaces would be needed to
                 accommodate all uses, so the parking requirements for the building are met.

                 The    Petitioner,       Tonja      Matthias,       approached.         Chairperson         Yeoman         read    aloud      the   conditions        of
                 approval. The Petitioner agreed to all.

                 Conditions of Approval:

                       1.   Approval of the Special Use Permit is for First Stop Chiropractic, LLC to operate a Medical
                            Office at 558 Gravois Road, Suite 201, as indicated on the plans provided with the application
                            and datedDecember 2, 2022.
                      2.    Compliance with all other applicable City Codes and Ordinances.

                Chairperson Yeoman made a motion to APPROVE CASE 2023-SUP-02 with the two (2) agreed
                upon conditions. Secretary Abbott seconded the motion.

            CASE 2023-TXT-01: Consideration of amendments to the City's Zoning Code to comply with
            recent amendments to the Missouri Constitution regarding medical and recreational marijuana
            use regulations.

            City Attorney Erin Seele gave a summary to the Commission regarding the draft ordinance related
            Amendment     3 of the   Missouri   Constitution for   recreational marijuana   use. She   stated that the
            amendment    for recreational, also known     as adult use, marijuana    is very similar to   medical use.
            Amendment 3 made changes         to the definitions to broaden the    use to include adult use,   so those
            changes were    incorporated   into the draft ordinance    to comply.    Similar to spacing   for medical
            marijuana, Amendment 3 allows        that no marijuana dispensary be     located within   l 000 feet of an
            existing school, church, or daycare facility and has provided definitions for those which have been
            incorporated into the draft ordinance to apply only to this chapter. The draft also provides for      l 000
            feet from other dispensary facilities. She added that no changes to cultivation or testing facilities are
           proposed other than removing the reference to "medical" as the uses would now just be for marijuana
            cultivation and testing and no changes to the allowable districts are proposed.

           City Attorney Seele stated     that while some cities will be treating medical marijuana dispensaries
           which are similar to pham1acies, differently than recreational use, which in the zoning world is very
           similar to a liquor store, Fenton allows pharmacies and liquor stores in the same zoning districts. Staff
           is therefore,   not proposing    any changes    to the current   districts that allow   medical   marijuana
           dispensaries. She   further added   that medical marijuana    dispensaries have a    constitutional right to
           convert their license to   comprehensive licenses to    sell both medical and recreational marijuana      as
           soon as February 6,    but that doesn't constitute zoning approval which is why the      draft ordinance is
           being   reviewed   tonight. She added    that dispensaries will   still require a SUP,   and Staff is   also
           proposing a SUP for any drive-through facilities in order to have additional review for traffic, access,
           and queuing spaces.

           Discussion ensued regarding the distinction between liquor stores and comprehensive facilities and
           the concern   that there are   differences with respect   to parking, traffic, and access   as well as   the
           potential for lines to form. Additional discussion was held regarding security, usage on premises and
           in public places, and odor control. Suggestions were made by the Commission on how these concerns
           could be addressed through conditions of approval under a Special Use Pennit.

           Chairperson Yeoman opened the meeting to Public Comment.

           Andrew Lammert and Kyle Lenzen, of Kind Goods in Gravois Bluffs, approached. Mr. Lammert
           stated that they intend to convert their existing medical marijuana license to a comprehensive license.
           He   stated that State regulations   for security and    odor control   are very stringent   and require   a
           significant investment to comply, and detailed the use of carbon filters, cameras, and other security
           measures. He also explained that proposed state regulations for recreational use are far more stringent
           than medical facilities and must be followed by anyone operating a dispensary and that compliance
           officers perfonn regular inspections.

           Discussion ensued regarding appropriate locations for Dispensary Facilities and the different burden
           to surrounding properties that may arise from comprehensive dispensaries versus medical marijuana
           dispensaries. It was decided by the Commission to remove dispensary facilities from the "HP-1" and
           "OT-2" Districts as recommended by Staff, and only allow them in the "C-1" District.

                 Following discussion, Chairperson Yeoman made a motion to APPROVE CASE 2023-TXT-01

                 District. Commissioner Bielicki seconded the motion.

                The property is zoned "C-1" Commercial District.

                Community            Development           Director       Amy       Starck      gave      a   summary         of    the    Staff     report     to   the
                Commission. A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department. She

                for a Comprehensive Dispensary Facility adding that the current location is not within 1000 feet of
                any church, daycare, school, or other dispensary as discussed under the previous text amendment case.

                The     Petitioners,       Andrew        Lammert         and    Kyle     Lenzen,        of Kind       Good      approached.          Mr.    Lammert
                described that the current operation of the facility for medical marijuana has complied with all state
                regulations as well as the requirements of the City. Mr. La1mnert offered that while there may be some
                early lines that will form once recreational sales are allowed, they do not anticipate the lines lasting
                more than a few weeks and do not foresee the same problems seen when recreational sales started in
                Illinois. Mr. Lenzen offered that he has leased many of the surrounding tenants on behalf the Grewe
                family and does not want to burden the existing businesses in any way as they cannot afford to lose
                any tenants. Mr.           Lammert went on to explain that the current use has the capability to                                          implement
                queuing software, similar to waitlist software utilized by restaurants, tl1at allows clients and customers
                to   check     in    and    save     their   place     in   line    while     waiting      in   their    car    or   patronizing        surrounding
                businesses. He also noted that they had the ability to wrap lines around the back of the building if
                needed to not block adjacent businesses. The anticipated number of patrons is estimated to be 20 per
                hour but the location could accommodate up to 40. The location currently has 117 parking spaces, and
                even with the existing uses onsite, has adequate parking.

                In response        to the     Commission's           concerns regarding            marijuana use          on the     premises,       Mr.    Lmmnert
                stated that it is policy that if any usage is observed the police will be notified and the patron will be
                banned from          the    facility.    Regarding odor concerns,                 the    Petitioners offered that their odor control
                measures are compliant with the state and an odor abatement plan has been completed. Additionally,

                 security measures are compliant with state requirements including the use of cameras. The Fenton
                 Police have toured the facility and have received no complaints about the current operation.

                 Discussion ensued regarding lines fonning and the potential for obstructing neighboring businesses,
                 who     has   an    obligation to        notify police if marijuana usage is                    observed, and how often the SUP                        is
                 inspected for compliance by the City                       It was decided by the Commission to amend the conditions of
                 approval       to    state    that    no    lines     can    obstruct       neighboring         businesses        six    (6)    weeks       after    the
                 commencement ofrecreational sales and the SUP would be inspected at six (6) weeks for compliance.
                 Additionally, the Commission suggested the conditions that the Petitioner use reasonable efforts to
                 operate queuing software to minimize lines forming around the building and to notify the police if
                 usage is seen on or around the premises. Chairperson Yeoman read aloud the amended conditions of

CASE 2023-SUP-01: A Petition by Best Box MO Gravois, LLC for a Special Use Permit to operate a Self-Storage Facility at 747 Gravois Road. The property is zoned "C-1" Commercial District.

Community Development Director Amy Starck gave a summary of the Staff report to the Commission. A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department. She explained that the proposed Self-Storage Facility received approval of a Special Use Permit in June and Site Plan Review in October. Most recently, the Board approved a request to rezone the parcel addressed as 743 Gravois Road included in the development plan in addition to a Boundary Adjustment Plat to combine 743 and 747 Gravois Road. The property was recently purchased by the Petitioner who intends to develop the proposed Self-Storage Facility with no changes to the previously approved conceptual design. She explained that, as Special Use Permits are non-transferrable, the Petitioner is seeking a new SUP due to a name change but no other changes are proposed from what was previously presented and approved. It was noted that no comments or concerns had been received by the Community Development Department relative to this request.

Noting that the Petitioner was not present, Chairperson Yeoman read aloud the conditions of approval for the record.

Conditions of Approval:

1. Approval of this Special Use Permit (SUP) is solely for Best Box Fenton MO Gravois, LLC to operate a Self-Storage Facility at 747 Gravois Road. However, if construction has not occurred within one (1) year of the issuance of this SUP the same will be null and void.
2. Access to the facility via a keypad/passcode will be limited to between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.

CASE 2023-SUP-02: A Petition by Tonja Matthias of First Stop Chiropractic, LLC for a Special Use Permit to operate a Medical Office at 558 Gravois Road, Suite 201. The property is zoned "OT-2" Olde Towne District.

Community Development Director Amy Starck gave a summary of the Staff report to the Commission. A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department. She explained that the proposed Medical Office will offer chiropractic care within the 720-square-foot tenant space. When queried about the parking, Director Starck stated that lot provided around 50 spaces and the required parking for the subject use would be 3 spaces based on the Zoning Code requirements. In looking at the existing uses within the building, around 39 spaces would be needed to accommodate all uses, so the parking requirements for the building are met.

The Petitioner, Tonja Matthias, approached. Chairperson Yeoman read aloud the conditions of approval. The Petitioner agreed to all.

Conditions of Approval:

1. Approval of the Special Use Permit is for First Stop Chiropractic, LLC to operate a Medical Office at 558 Gravois Road, Suite 201, as indicated on the plans provided with the application and dated December 2, 2022.

CASE 2023-TXT-01: Consideration of amendments to the City's Zoning Code to comply with recent amendments to the Missouri Constitution regarding medical and recreational marijuana use regulations.

City Attorney Erin Seele gave a summary to the Commission regarding the draft ordinance related to Amendment 3 of the Missouri Constitution for recreational marijuana use. She stated that the amendment for recreational, also known as adult use, marijuana is very similar to medical use. Amendment 3 made changes to the definitions to broaden the use to include adult use, so those changes were incorporated into the draft ordinance to comply. Similar to spacing for medical marijuana, Amendment 3 allows that no marijuana dispensary be located within 1000 feet of an existing school, church, or daycare facility and has provided definitions for those which have been incorporated into the draft ordinance to apply only to this chapter. The draft also provides for 1000 feet from other dispensary facilities. She added that no changes to cultivation or testing facilities are proposed other than removing the reference to "medical" as the uses would now just be for marijuana cultivation and testing and no changes to the allowable districts are proposed.

City Attorney Seele stated that while some cities will be treating medical marijuana dispensaries similarly to pharmacies, differently than recreational use, which in the zoning world is very similar to a liquor store, Fenton allows pharmacies and liquor stores in the same zoning districts. Staff is therefore, not proposing any changes to the current districts that allow medical marijuana dispensaries. She further added that medical marijuana dispensaries have a constitutional right to convert their license to comprehensive licenses to sell both medical and recreational marijuana as soon as February 6, but that doesn't constitute zoning approval which is why the draft ordinance is being reviewed tonight. She added that dispensaries will still require a SUP, and Staff is also proposing a SUP for any drive-through facilities in order to have additional review for traffic, access, and queuing spaces.

Discussion ensued regarding the distinction between liquor stores and comprehensive facilities and the concern that there are differences with respect to parking, traffic, and access as well as the potential for lines to form. Additional

 discussion was held regarding security, usage on premises and in public places, and odor control. Suggestions were made by the Commission on how these concerns could be addressed through conditions of approval under a Special Use Permit.

Chairperson Yeoman opened the meeting to Public Comment.

Andrew Lammert and Kyle Lenzen, of Kind Goods in Gravois Bluffs, approached. Mr. Lammert stated that they intend to convert their existing medical marijuana license to a comprehensive license. He stated that State regulations for security and odor control are very stringent and require a significant investment to comply, and detailed the use of carbon filters, cameras, and other security measures. He also explained that proposed state regulations for recreational use are far more stringent than medical facilities and must be followed by anyone operating a dispensary and that compliance officers perform regular inspections.

Discussion ensued regarding appropriate locations for Dispensary Facilities and the different burden to surrounding properties that may arise from comprehensive dispensaries versus medical marijuana dispensaries. It was decided by the Commission to remove dispensary facilities from the "HP-1" and "OT-2" Districts as recommended by Staff, and only allow them in the "C-1" District.

Following discussion, Chairperson Yeoman made a motion to APPROVE CASE 2023-TXT-01 with the recommendation that Dispensary Facilities only be allowed in the "C-1" Commercial District. Commissioner Bielicki seconded the motion.

CASE 2023-SUP-03: A Petition by Kind Goods Fenton, LLC, for a Special Use Permit to operate a Comprehensive Marijuana Dispensary Facility at 180 Gravois Bluffs Circle, Suite B. The property is zoned "C-1" Commercial District.

Community Development Director Amy Starck gave a summary of the Staff report to the Commission. A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department. She explained that LSL Management received a Special Use Permit in 2019 to operate a Medical Marijuana Dispensary in the subject location. The Petitioner is now requesting a Special Use Permit for a Comprehensive Dispensary Facility adding that the current location is not within 1000 feet of any church, daycare, school, or other dispensary as discussed under the previous text amendment case.

The Petitioners, Andrew Lammert and Kyle Lenzen, of Kind Goods approached. Mr. Lammert described that the current operation of the facility for medical marijuana has complied with all state regulations as well as the requirements of the City. Mr. Lammert offered that while there may be some early lines that will form once recreational sales are allowed, they do not anticipate the lines lasting more than a few weeks and do not foresee the same problems seen when recreational sales started in Illinois. Mr. Lenzen offered that he has leased many of the surrounding tenants on behalf of the Grewe family and does not want to burden the existing businesses in any way as they cannot afford to lose any tenants. Mr. Lammert went on to explain that the current use has the capability to implement queuing software, similar to waitlist software utilized by restaurants, that allows clients and customers to check in and save their place in line while waiting in their car or patronizing surrounding businesses. He also noted that they had the ability to wrap lines around the back of the building if needed to not block adjacent businesses. The anticipated number of patrons is estimated to be 20 per hour but the location could accommodate up to 40. The location currently has 117 parking spaces, and even with the existing uses onsite, has adequate parking.

In response to the Commission's concerns regarding marijuana use on the premises, Mr. Lammert stated that it is policy that if any usage is observed the police will be notified and the patron will be banned from the facility. Regarding odor concerns, the Petitioners offered that their odor control measures are compliant with the state and an odor abatement plan has been completed. Additionally, security measures are compliant with state requirements including the use of cameras. The Fenton Police have toured the facility and have received no complaints about the current operation.

Discussion ensued regarding lines forming and the potential for obstructing neighboring businesses, who has an obligation to notify police if marijuana usage is observed, and how often the SUP is inspected for compliance by the City It was decided by the Commission to amend the conditions of approval to state that no lines can obstruct neighboring businesses six (6) weeks after the commencement of recreational sales and the SUP would be

 inspected at six (6) weeks for compliance. Additionally, the Commission suggested the conditions that the Petitioner use reasonable efforts to operate queuing software to minimize lines forming around the building and to notify the police if usage is seen on or around the premises. Chairperson Yeoman read aloud the amended conditions of approval. The Petitioner agreed to all.

Following discussion, Chairperson Yeoman made a motion to APPROVE CASE 2023-SUP-03 with the eight (8) revised conditions of approval. The motion was seconded by Secretary Abbott.

Conditions of Approval:

1. This Special Use Permit approval is solely for Kind Goods Fenton, LLC to operate a Comprehensive Marijuana Dispensary Facility at 180 Gravois Bluffs Circle, Suite B, in compliance with Chapter 430, Article IX of the Zoning Code.
2. Proof of State Licensing, as required under Section 430.680 of the Zoning Code, must be provided to the Community Development Director before an Occupancy Permit for a Comprehensive Marijuana Dispensary for Kind Goods Fenton, LLC will be issued for the subject location.
