Does not include informal gatherings for social or educational purposes when there is no intent to avoid the purposes of the Sunshine Law. Sunshine Law requires the City to allow for audio, video, or other recordings of open meetings.\n\nIf you send an email or other electronic communication relating to public business where a quorum of the Parks and Recreation Committee is on the communication, you must concurrently transmit that message to either your Fenton email account or the City Clerk 610.025 RSMo.\n\nNo appointed or elected official or employee shall:\n- Use or disclose confidential information with intent to result in financial gain for themselves, their spouse, their child, or any business with which he/she is associated.\n- Perform any service, or refrain from acting or influence a decision by reason of any payment, offer to pay, promise to pay, or receipt of anything of pecuniary value.\n- Favorably act on any matter that is specifically designed so as to provide a peculiar monetary benefit or result for any property or service, to the City in excess of $500 per transaction or $5,000 per year unless competitively bid and provided the bid is the lowest received.\n- Receive compensation for any service or becomes engaged in a transaction that could influence a decision.\n\nJust because the action does not violate chapter 105 prohibitions or other prohibitions, it does not mean there is not an appearance of a conflict. When in doubt, consult counsel to resolve.\n\nSovereign Immunity"}]
