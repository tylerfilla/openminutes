Cruts, Chairman (Wisbrock, Huels, Jokers/)\nAlderman Cruts inquired on clarification on procedures for Aldermen. He feels each Alderman represents\nhis/her own ward and that an Alderman is to bring concerns or issues of their ward residents to the Board\nfor discussion. If discussion at the Committee meeting warrants additional input, the topic is voted on to\nopen the discussion topic to the full Board. He feels there have been some incidents that have occurred of\nan Alderman addressing concerns in his ward and feels that has brought stress and concerns to his ward\nconstituents.\n\nAlderman Bereitschaft shared his thoughts on Goode Drive incident of an Alderman addressing concerns\n                                                                               nd\noutside his ward. At the October 2                                                  Committee meeting, the Board was advised to let Staff and Police\nDepartment conduct conversation with Goode Drive residents regarding options related to traffic concerns\non their street. He visited the street for observation of the concern but did not speak to any of the residents.\n                                                                                                               nd\nHowever, one of the residents at the November 2                                                                     meeting thanked one of the other ward Alderman for\n\n\n                                                                                                                    3\n                                                                                      Board of Aldennen Committee Meeting\n                                                                                                      November 9, 2023\n\f\nhelping to resolve the concern. He expressed he was not happy with an Alderman from another ward not\nfollowing procedures.\n\nAlderman Wisbrock shared that he also visited to Goode Drive area for observation of upcoming topic. He\nshared Ken Norton stopped him to thank him that the consideration of traffic concerns was being discussed.\nHe has known Ken Norton since he was five (5) years old, Ken's mom and dad were his den leaders. He\napologized if this offended anyone, he stopped in his vehicle and talked to a friend that waved him down,\nand he encouraged Ken Norton to speak with his                               Ward      l representatives and suggested that he                     invite\nresidents of that area to the Board meeting.\n\nCity Attorney Erin Seele shared she feels Aldermen going door to door can create mixed messages and the\nCity's proper protocol is to have Staff address concerns for an organized process.\n\nAlderman Maserang shared he feels it is an Alderman's responsibility to interact with the community but\nnot going door to door, as wrong advice may be given, he would advise them to contact City Hall. He\nfurther shared that he also visited Goode Drive for observation to educate himself on the upcoming topic.\nAldennan Maserang shared before he become an Alderman, he would contact an Alderman outside his\nward to inquire or address concerns because he knew that Alderman. That Alderman would listen and direct\nhim to who he needed to speak to.\n\nAlderman Huels shared, she is contacted by residents outside her ward and will help them if she is able or\nshe will direct them to who they need to speak with.\n\n\u2022     September 30, 2023, Monthly Financial Report.\n      Alderman Cruts summarized the monthly financial report.

If approved, the employee will be required to sign the City Credit Card Usage Agreement, as\n      required by the City's Financial Policy.\n\n      Alderman Cruts made a motion to forward to the November Board of Aldermen meeting the request for\n     a credit card for the Recreation Supervisor, Kyler Campbell, with a $5,000 credit limit. The motion was\n      seconded by Alderman Wisbrock.

Tom Verheyen, RiverChase YMCA Executive Director and Millie Matronia, YMCA Senior Program Director were in attendance of the meeting. The RiverChase 2023 and 2024 financials were available for review.\n\nMr. Verheyen shared that currently there are 1,990 paying monthly household membership units: 5,456 individuals and 2,343 individuals on insurance-based membership programs, totaling 7,799 individuals. The RiverChase YMCA is in the top 25% membership units of the twenty-four (24) YMCA associations. They are approximately at two-thirds (2/3) capacity for the facility of 3,000 units.\n\nMayor Maurath inquired on how many of those memberships were City of Fenton residents. Mr. Verheyen stated he would provide City membership information to Staff and voiced that the legacy rate that is offered to Fenton residents has a great retention, and they have no interest in expiring the legacy rate.

Mr. Verheyen noted for the record the amenity of the outdoor pool brings in influx of memberships, and that benefit policy is not going to change.\n\nMr. Verheyen overviewed that contribution margin for 2022 was $199,614, 2023 is forecasted at $695,607, and anticipated for 2024 $630,833. The margin is based on membership, retention and member-facing expenses. They will be extending pool hours in 2024, increasing the number of water exercise classes from nineteen (19) when they started to eighty-three (83) per week.\n\nThe RiverChase YMCA is anticipating 2024 revenue of $3,472,868 and expenses of $2,842,035. As it relates to the City and YMCA agreement, the agreement calls for an operational reserve bucket to be filled first in the amount of $250,000. In 2022 that bucket was allocated $199,614, and in 2023 the operational reserve bucket will be allocated $50,386 of the $695,607 contribution margin, leaving $645,221 to be split between operational reserve bucket with $250,000 to maximize out the $500,000 cap on the operational reserve bucket and $395,221 allocated to the capital reserve bucket. Mr. Verheyen further shared that $104,780 of the anticipated 2024 contribution margin of $630,833 will be allocated to the capital reserve bucket filling the maximum bucket of $500,000. Leaving a balance of $526,053 to be split between the City and the YMCA per the agreement. This is ahead of the anticipated schedule. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner shared the capital bucket assists the City in expenses for capital project improvements for RiverChase YMCA.

City Administrator shared it will be reviewed in the future for adjustment needs in lieu of a refund, noting that as funds in the buckets are used, they will need to be refilled.\n\nMr. Verheyen noted for the record, due to the success they are observing, he anticipates the YMCA being fully operational self-sufficient in the next couple of years without subsidy from the City.\n\nMayor Maurath stated for the record he feels the YMCA has done a great job with the operation of the facility and hopes it continues.\n\nAlderman Wisbrock inquired if the Carondelet YMCA was self-sufficient.

Cruts, Chairman (Wisbrock, Huels, Jokers/)\nAlderman Cruts inquired on clarification on procedures for Aldermen. He feels each Alderman represents his/her own ward and that an Alderman is to bring concerns or issues of their ward residents to the Board for discussion. If discussion at the Committee meeting warrants additional input, the topic is voted on to open the discussion topic to the full Board. He feels there have been some incidents that have occurred of an Alderman addressing concerns in his ward and feels that has brought stress and concerns to his ward constituents.\n\nAlderman Bereitschaft shared his thoughts on Goode Drive incident of an Alderman addressing concerns outside his ward. At the October 2nd Committee meeting, the Board was advised to let Staff and Police Department conduct conversation with Goode Drive residents regarding options related to traffic concerns on their street. He visited the street for observation of the concern but did not speak to any of the residents. However, one of the residents at the November 2nd meeting thanked one of the other ward Alderman for helping to resolve the concern. He expressed he was not happy with an Alderman from another ward not following procedures.\n\nAlderman Wisbrock shared that he also visited the Goode Drive area for observation of the upcoming topic. He shared Ken Norton stopped him to thank him that the consideration of traffic concerns was being discussed. He has known Ken Norton since he was five (5) years old, Ken's mom and dad were his den leaders. He apologized if this offended anyone, he stopped in his vehicle and talked to a friend that waved him down, and he encouraged Ken Norton to speak with his Ward 1 representatives and suggested that he invite residents of that area to the Board meeting.\n\nCity Attorney Erin Seele shared she feels Aldermen going door to door can create mixed messages and the City's proper protocol is to have Staff address concerns for an organized process.\n\nAlderman Maserang shared he feels it is an Alderman's responsibility to interact with the community but not going door to door, as wrong advice may be given, he would advise them to contact City Hall. He further shared that he also visited Goode Drive for observation to educate himself on the upcoming topic. Alderman Maserang shared before he became an Alderman, he would contact an Alderman outside his ward to inquire or address concerns because he knew that Alderman. That Alderman would listen and direct him to who he needed to speak to.\n\nAlderman Huels shared, she is contacted by residents outside her ward and will help them if she is able or she will direct them to who they need to speak with.\n\nSeptember 30, 2023, Monthly Financial Report.\nAlderman Cruts summarized the monthly financial report.
