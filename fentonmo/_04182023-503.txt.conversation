The parcel is zoned \"HP-1\"\n           Hospitality Park District.\n\n           Petitioner, Jiten Patel, approached the Board to present his request. He explained that he is\n           proposing to construct a new hotel building on the property, and in order to accommodate\n           a drive aisle next to the entrance canopy, the parking lot would encroach the buffer area\n           along the east property line. In response to questions about the size of the entrance canopy,\n           he explained that the canopy, including the dimensions and adjacent drive aisle are required\n           by the hotel franchise. He further stated that the only portion to encroach was that portion\n           adjacent to the canopy, and the required buffer can be provided along the remainder of the\n           east lot line. The canopy would provide a vehicle parking during check-in, and the drive\n           aisle would ensure emergency service vehicles access to the remainder of the property.\n\n          Vaishali   Patel approached    and took the Oath for Testimony.        She explained that the\n          franchise brand controls the dimensions for the hotel, locations of the entrances, etc. In\n          order to provide a 24' drive aisle adjacent to the proposed entrance canopy as required by\n          the brand, the encroachment was necessary. She further added that other configurations\n          were attempted to meet franchise requirements, but they were not feasible due to the shape\n          of the property.\n\n          The Board questioned the Petitioner regarding landscaping on the property. The Petitioner\n          stated that landscaping is proposed when the property is developed with the new hotel. It\n          was   noted that   the proposed    site plan for the   new development      will provide   more\n          landscaping and green space than currently exists on the property.\n\n          Vice Chairperson Siebert read the proposed conditions of approval and the Petitioner\n          agreed to them all.\n\n          For the record, Community Development Director Amy Starck stated that she had received\n          no calls or questions from the public concerning the requested variance.\n\f\nBoard of Adjustment                                                                                                                        Page 3\nMinutes of Meeting\nApril 18, 2023\n                Vice Chairperson Siebert asked for public comment.

The parcel is zoned \"CP-1\" Commercial Park District.\n\n               Petitioner's representative, Karl Schoenike of CEC, Inc., approached the Board to address\n               any questions they may have regarding the Petition. He stated for the record he agreed to\n               all of the proposed conditions.                He explained that the current parking lot has been in place\n               for approximately 35 years and has not changed since the property was developed. Estes\n               Trucking would like to expand the parking lot in order to construct a building addition, but\n               a variance is needed for the existing parking lot encroachment before that can happen. Mr.\n               Schoenike described the areas of encroachment along the front lot lines and explained the\n               varying widths of the encroachment due to MoDot taking some of the property for a tum\n               lane.\n\n               The Board discussed the feasibility of removing that portion of the parking lot within the\n               buffer area and restriping the lot. Mr. Schoenike explained that this would cause a number\n               of employee parking spaces to be removed in order to provide a drive aisle width large\n               enough for two-way traffic.\n\f\nBoard of Adjustment\n                                                                                                                                         Page4\nMinutes of Meeting\nApril 18, 2023\n\n                For the record, Community Development Director Starck stated that she had received no\n                calls or questions from the public concerning the requested variance.\n\n                Vice Chairperson Siebert asked for public comment.

The parcel is zoned \"HP-1\" Hospitality Park District.\n\nPetitioner, Jiten Patel, approached the Board to present his request. He explained that he is proposing to construct a new hotel building on the property, and in order to accommodate a drive aisle next to the entrance canopy, the parking lot would encroach the buffer area along the east property line. In response to questions about the size of the entrance canopy, he explained that the canopy, including the dimensions and adjacent drive aisle are required by the hotel franchise. He further stated that the only portion to encroach was that portion adjacent to the canopy, and the required buffer can be provided along the remainder of the east lot line. The canopy would provide a vehicle parking during check-in, and the drive aisle would ensure emergency service vehicles access to the remainder of the property.\n\nVaishali Patel approached and took the Oath for Testimony. She explained that the franchise brand controls the dimensions for the hotel, locations of the entrances, etc. In order to provide a 24' drive aisle adjacent to the proposed entrance canopy as required by the brand, the encroachment was necessary. She further added that other configurations were attempted to meet franchise requirements, but they were not feasible due to the shape of the property.\n\nThe Board questioned the Petitioner regarding landscaping on the property. The Petitioner stated that landscaping is proposed when the property is developed with the new hotel. It was noted that the proposed site plan for the new development will provide more landscaping and green space than currently exists on the property.\n\nVice Chairperson Siebert read the proposed conditions of approval and the Petitioner agreed to them all.\n\nFor the record, Community Development Director Amy Starck stated that she had received no calls or questions from the public concerning the requested variance.\n\nVice Chairperson Siebert asked for public comment.

The parcel is zoned \"CP-1\" Commercial Park District.\n\nPetitioner's representative, Karl Schoenike of CEC, Inc., approached the Board to address any questions they may have regarding the Petition. He stated for the record he agreed to all of the proposed conditions. He explained that the current parking lot has been in place for approximately 35 years and has not changed since the property was developed. Estes Trucking would like to expand the parking lot in order to construct a building addition, but a variance is needed for the existing parking lot encroachment before that can happen. Mr. Schoenike described the areas of encroachment along the front lot lines and explained the varying widths of the encroachment due to MoDot taking some of the property for a turn lane.\n\nThe Board discussed the feasibility of removing that portion of the parking lot within the buffer area and restriping the lot. Mr. Schoenike explained that this would cause a number of employee parking spaces to be removed in order to provide a drive aisle width large enough for two-way traffic.\n\nFor the record, Community Development Director Starck stated that she had received no calls or questions from the public concerning the requested variance.\n\nVice Chairperson Siebert asked for public comment. No person came forward in favor or against the Petition. Vice Chairperson Siebert closed the public comment portion of the meeting. Discussion ensued among the members.\n\nMember Mooney made a motion to APPROVE, WITH CONDITIONS, CASE 2023-V-02. Member Phillips seconded the motion.\n\nConditions of Approval:\n\n1. This approval is solely for a variance from 415.180(E)(2) to enlarge an existing non-conforming Off-Street Parking Area that encroaches the required 30-foot front Buffer Areas along Cassens Drive by 18 feet creating a 12-foot Buffer Area and along Soccer Park Road by 7 feet creating a 23-foot Buffer area, as indicated on plans dated March 20, 2023.\n2.
