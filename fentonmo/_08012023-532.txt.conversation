A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department.\n            Director Starck explained that the plat was reviewed for compliance with the Subdivision Code and\n            Amended Ordinance 4002 Master Zoning Ordinance for the development and was found to meet the\n            requirements of both. She noted that the lots will be accessed via a private access and utility easement\n            running through     the center of the     13.525-acre parcel    and evidence of a Maintenance Agreement,\n            similar to others done within the development, will be required.\n\n            The Petitioner, Scott Haley of US Capital Development, approached.

The\n            subdivision will create 7 new lots.\n\n            The Commission asked about prospective businesses for the undeveloped lots.

The     property       is addressed         as   750    Assembly         Parkway        and     zoned     \"PID\"\n                Planned Industrial Development.\n\n                Community            Development           Director       Amy       Starck      gave      a   summary         of    the    Staff     report     to   the\n                Commission. A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department. She\n                explained the Petitioner is proposing a pole sign or signs along North Highway Drive. The proposed\n                50' height and 200 square-foot sign face                         exceed the maximum 35'                  height and        150 square-foot sign\n                face allowed when signs are proposed along Interstate frontage. Additionally, the Site Plan appears to\n                indicate either one (1) proposed Pole Sign at the location labeled Option A, or two (2) Pole Signs, one\n                at each of the locations labeled Option B.\n\n                The Petitioner, Scott Haley from                     US    Capital Development, approached.                       He clarified that only one\n                Pole Sign is proposed, and the location would be either Option A, or one of the two locations provided\n                as Options        B on the Site Plan. He explained the purpose of the proposed Pole Sign was to showcase\n                the    area    as the     sign    would      include      spaces     for    all seven      future     tenants      on the      seven     future     lots.\n                Additionally,         it would aid        in showing potential              users that signage along North Highway Drive to\n                identify their business had been approved by the City. Mr. Haley added that the sign would not be\n                erected before the buildings were built.\n\n                The Commission discussed concerns with approving a Sign Plan for undeveloped property and future\n                signage that may be requested for the development along North Highway Drive. Director Starck stated\n                that any future          signage that would              not meet the         requirements          of the     Sign Code would              require     a\n                separate Sign Plan that would be brought to the Commission for review and consideration. Mayor\n                Maurath noted that the City has approved similar signs for other developments in the City (Gravois\n                Bluffs, Dierbergs Fenton Crossing, and Fenton Plaza).\n\n                Following discussion Chairperson Yeoman suggested amending the conditions of approval to clarify\n                the locations of the proposed Pole Sign and                          that the request is for a single sign at only the location\n                indicated in Option A, or only one of the two locations in Option B on the Site Plan.\n\n                Chairperson Yeoman read aloud the amended conditions of approval. The Petitioner agreed to all.\n\f\nPlanning and Zoning Commission Meeting                                                                                                                                                             Page4\nAugust 1, 2023\n\n\n                       Conditions of Approval:\n                               I.

Any proposed future Signs for the subject Lots that are not in compliance with the Sign Code\n                                      shall       require          a    separate           Sign       Plan       review.

Corbin Holtzman explained the proposed tenant\n                     will discretely operate strictly to transport marijuana product, packaging, money, and other products\n                     within          the      cannabis            industry,            with       additional             lab      testing         consisting             of small             samples,            but      that\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                rd\n                     transportation is their main function. He added that Marijuana Businesses are required to have a 3\n                     party to take product from point A to point B which is what would be provided by the tenant. He also\n                     added that the tenant has a board of security advisors and there will be security cameras and access\n                     control to the facility. He also offered that there would be a I0'Xl5' room containing an 8'xl0' safe\n                     should any product need to be stored overnight, but the goal is to not store it at the facility.\n\f\nPlanning and Zoning Commission Meeting                                                                                                          Page5\nAugust 1, 2023\n\n\n                 When asked about how much product might be brought in or stored on site at any given time, he\n                 stated none because they do not intend to bring product back to the facility. Petitioner Doug Holtzman\n                 stated that legally, product cannot come through the facility. When asked to clarify how testing would\n                 be performed and             the   need     for   8xl O safe       if no    product could          come through the             facility,   Corbin\n                 answered that minimal quantities, no more than a briefcase worth, would be anticipated. Petitioner\n                 Doug Holtzman offered that the 10xl5 room would be used to store product on an emergency basis\n                 with    an   area to     perform       some testing.         No details were provided about the                      area for testing.           The\n                 Commission also questioned the Petitioner about the traffic the tenant would create and what type of\n                 vehicles would be used. Corbin answered that it would create minimal traffic and deliveries would be\n                 by a cargo van that would blend in with other traffic and be discreet.\n\n                 The     Commission           asked      the    Petitioners       additional       questions       regarding        security      measures        and\n                procedures, odor control, and general operations of the business. Doug Holtzman queried why this\n                 information        was     needed      as   it would       be   primarily       a   back    office     logistic    operation       serving      as   a\n                call/dispatch center and that those sorts of requirements are regulated by the State. He further stated\n                that they have specs of the building for construction and are comfortable speaking on behalf of the\n                tenant as the property owner. City Attorney, Erin Seele made clear that, as the City's code is written,\n                State     requirements         are   also    Fenton's       requirements,         and    other    Marijuana        facilities     have    provided\n                details     about     safety,     security,     filters    for   odor    control,      and    other    operational        information        for   the\n                Commission's peace of mind adding that the information is needed to make the required findings and\n                understand         the    proposed        use.    Additionally,         Chairperson         Yeoman         explained        the    standards       the\n                Commission uses             to   review a       SUP,     and as      this   is not an      allowed      Use that is        permitted      by   right,\n                sufficient information has not been provided to meet that obligation.\n\n                Following         discussion,        Mayor       Maurath        suggested        continuing        as    the    Commission           needs      more\n                information and discussion with tenant.\n\n                Chairperson Yeoman made a motion to CONTINUE CASE 2023-SUP-11.

The property is addressed as 750 Assembly Parkway and zoned \"PID\" Planned Industrial Development.\n\nCommunity Development Director Amy Starck gave a summary of the Staff report to the Commission. A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department. Director Starck explained that the plat was reviewed for compliance with the Subdivision Code and Amended Ordinance 4002 Master Zoning Ordinance for the development and was found to meet the requirements of both. She noted that the lots will be accessed via a private access and utility easement running through the center of the 13.525-acre parcel and evidence of a Maintenance Agreement, similar to others done within the development, will be required.\n\nThe Petitioner, Scott Haley of US Capital Development, approached. He explained the proposed plat will subdivide the final undeveloped parcel located in Area A of the planned development. The subdivision will create 7 new lots.\n\nThe Commission asked about prospective businesses for the undeveloped lots. Mr. Haley explained that they have been meeting with prospective users and hope to have an anchor soon to complete the final 13 acres of development.\n\nChairperson Yeoman read aloud the conditions of approval. The Petitioner agreed to all.\n\nConditions of Approval:\n1. This approval is for the subdivision of an existing parcel containing 13.526 acres into seven (7) Lots, as shown on the plat submitted with the application and dated July 5, 2023.\n2. An Access Maintenance Agreement shall be established for the private access easement and a copy of the same provided to Community Development for City records.\n3. The Petitioner shall provide two (2) copies of the approved Preliminary Plat to the Community Development Director so that they may be signed by the Director. The plat shall state that the approval is not final and that the Preliminary Plat is not to be recorded.\n4. Compliance with all other applicable codes and ordinances of the City of Fenton.\n\n\nFollowing discussion Chairperson Yeoman made a motion to APPROVE, with conditions, CASE 2023-SUB-01.

The property is addressed as 750 Assembly Parkway and zoned \"PID\" Planned Industrial Development.\n\nCommunity Development Director Amy Starck gave a summary of the Staff report to the Commission. A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department. She explained the Petitioner is proposing a pole sign or signs along North Highway Drive. The proposed 50' height and 200 square-foot sign face exceed the maximum 35' height and 150 square-foot sign face allowed when signs are proposed along Interstate frontage. Additionally, the Site Plan appears to indicate either one (1) proposed Pole Sign at the location labeled Option A, or two (2) Pole Signs, one at each of the locations labeled Option B.\n\nThe Petitioner, Scott Haley from US Capital Development, approached. He clarified that only one Pole Sign is proposed, and the location would be either Option A, or one of the two locations provided as Options B on the Site Plan. He explained the purpose of the proposed Pole Sign was to showcase the area as the sign would include spaces for all seven future tenants on the seven future lots. Additionally, it would aid in showing potential users that signage along North Highway Drive to identify their business had been approved by the City. Mr. Haley added that the sign would not be erected before the buildings were built.\n\nThe Commission discussed concerns with approving a Sign Plan for undeveloped property and future signage that may be requested for the development along North Highway Drive. Director Starck stated that any future signage that would not meet the requirements of the Sign Code would require a separate Sign Plan that would be brought to the Commission for review and consideration. Mayor Maurath noted that the City has approved similar signs for other developments in the City (Gravois Bluffs, Dierbergs Fenton Crossing, and Fenton Plaza).\n\nFollowing discussion Chairperson Yeoman suggested amending the conditions of approval to clarify the locations of the proposed Pole Sign and that the request is for a single sign at only the location indicated in Option A, or only one of the two locations in Option B on the Site Plan.\n\nChairperson Yeoman read aloud the amended conditions of approval. The Petitioner agreed to all.\n\nConditions of Approval:\n1. The Sign Plan approval is for a single Pole Sign positioned at any one of the locations identified in either Option A or Option B, as indicated on the Site Plan submitted with the application and dated July 6, 2023.\n2. Any proposed future Signs for the subject Lots that are not in compliance with the Sign Code shall require a separate Sign Plan review. Nothing in this requirement shall prevent the installation of new Signs in compliance with the Sign Code, via applicable permits.\n3. Municipal Zoning Approval by the City of Fenton and a Sign Permit issued by St. Louis County will be required for the proposed signs.\n4. Compliance with all other applicable City Codes and Ordinances.\n\nFollowing discussion Chairperson Yeoman made a motion to APPROVE, with amended conditions, CASE 2023-SP-02. Commissioner Voorhees seconded the motion.\n\nRoll Call:\nChairperson Callan Yeoman Aye\nVice-Chairperson Kevin Sherrel Absent\nSecretary Deborah Abbott Aye\nCommissioner Bill Voorhees Aye\nCommissioner Warren Wisbrock Aye\nCommissioner Bill Glover Aye\nCommissioner Linda Nelson Aye\nCommissioner John Bielicki Aye\nAlderman Ron Harrell Aye\nMayor Joe Maurath Aye\n\n9 Ayes; 0 Nays; 1 Absent: Motion APPROVED\n\nCASE 2023-SUP-11: A Petition by Corbin Holtzman on behalf of Talaria MO, LLC for a Special Use Permit to operate a Marijuana Transportation Facility at 2275 Cassens Drive, Suite 130. The parcel is addressed as 143 Cassens Court and is zoned \"IP-1\" Industrial Park District.\n\nCommunity Development Director Amy Starck gave a summary of the Staff report to the Commission. A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department. She explained that the proposed Marijuana Transportation Facility is not within 1,000 feet of any Church, School, or Daycare Facility, as required, but that additional information about the proposed operation, including security measures and odor control, and visibility of the product from outside the facility by the public were not provided with the application.\n\nThe Petitioners, Corbin Holtzman and Doug Holtzman, owners of the property and speaking on behalf of the tenant, Talaria MO, LLC, appeared via Zoom. Corbin Holtzman explained the proposed tenant will discretely operate strictly to transport marijuana product, packaging, money, and other products within the cannabis industry, with additional lab testing consisting of small samples, but that transportation is their main function. He added that Marijuana Businesses are required to have a 3rd party to take product from point A to point B which is what would be provided by the tenant. He also added that the tenant has a board of security advisors and there will be security cameras and access control to the facility. He also offered that there would be a 10'X15' room containing an 8'x10' safe should any product need to be stored overnight, but the goal is to not store it at the facility.\n\nWhen asked about how much product might be brought in or stored on site at any given time, he stated none because they do not intend to bring product back to the facility. Petitioner Doug Holtzman stated that legally, product cannot come through the facility. When asked to clarify how testing would be performed and the need for 8x10 safe if no product could come through the facility, Corbin answered that minimal quantities, no more than a briefcase worth, would be anticipated. Petitioner Doug Holtzman offered that the 10x15 room would be used to store product on an emergency basis with an area to perform some testing. No details were provided about the area for testing. The Commission also questioned the Petitioner about the traffic the tenant would create and what type of vehicles would be used. Corbin answered that it would create minimal traffic and deliveries would be by a cargo van that would blend in with other traffic and be discreet.\n\nThe Commission asked the Petitioners additional questions regarding security measures and procedures, odor control, and general operations of the business. Doug Holtzman queried why this information was needed as it would be primarily a back office logistic operation serving as a call/dispatch center and that those sorts of requirements are regulated by the State. He further stated that they have specs of the building for construction and are comfortable speaking on behalf of the tenant as the property owner. City Attorney, Erin Seele made clear that, as the City's code is written, State requirements are also Fenton's requirements, and other Marijuana facilities have provided details about safety, security, filters for odor control, and other operational information for the Commission's peace of mind adding that the information is needed to make the required findings and understand the proposed use.
