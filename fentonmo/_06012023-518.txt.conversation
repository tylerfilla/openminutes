Clauss, Chairman (Cruts, Harrell, Jokerst)\n\u2022    Consideration of a request by STL Athletic Center to amend the Traffic Code to allow parking\n     on Hitzert Court.\n     Michael Marscheutz of STL Athletic Center, located at 2300 Hitzert Court, is requesting an amendment\n     to the Code to allow parking along Hitzert Court, which is not permitted at any time under Schedule\n     VIII of the City's Traffic Code.\n\n     STL Athletic Center received approval of a Special Use Permit (SUP) to operate an Indoor Unlimited\n     Recreational Facility under Ordinance 3907, as amended by Ordinance 4213, with a condition that, \"the\n     parking on-site shall be/remain sufficient for the use of the property.\" Recently, large events (gun\n     shows, sneaker events) have been held at this location where on-site parking has not been sufficient for\n     the use, putting their SUP at risk of being revoked.\n\n     Mike Marscheutz, 2300 Hitzert Court, Fenton MO 63026 shared a presentation overview outlining his\n     request for additional parking (attached as part of the minutes). He is proposing parallel parking spaces\n     on the shoulder of Hitzert Court on both sides of his building, of which Hitzert Court is owned by STL\n     Athletic. Additional parking would only be utilized for big events ( 4-6 per year) when there are slow\n     times    of his     business.     Currently      he   is   using    the   neighboring       business      parking     lot   with   verbal\n     authorization of the tenant, which is not allowed under the City Code. STL Athletic proposes to pave\n     and strip the gravel shoulder in the next year if the proposal is approved.\n\n     Mr. Marscheutz shared Hitzert Court is very wide to help facilitate truck traffic, approximately forty\n     feet (40') wide in some areas not including the shoulder. He feels he could maintain parallel parking\n     with a pedestrian walkway.\n\n     Mayor Maurath inquired if more parking spaces could be created on the back side of the building and\n     if the City has ability to regulate private street parking. City Attorney Erin See le replied yes for safety\n     reasons.\n\n     City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner noted there could be concerns with swales in Metropolitan Sewer\n     District (MSD) right-of-way due to additional impervious surfaces. She further shared a typical street\n     is twenty-six feet (26') wide within a fifty-foot (50') right-of-way. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner\n    shared the Fenton Fire Protection District (FFFD) stated they do not have concerns of parking along\n    eastern part of Hitzert Court with the width of the road. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner expressed\n    concerns that if stripped it may be deemed a parking lot not an access way placing it under a different\n    Code. She suggested it not be stripped and deemed on street parking.\n\n    City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner has discussed with Mr. Marscheutz that he needs to review the\n    existing access easement agreements on the property, minimally with the property to the north (lot B),\n    to determine if this parking may cause any violations of same.\n\n    Alderman Clauss inquired on concerns of parked cars being hit by trucks entering and exiting docking\n    facilities located across the street. Mr. Marscheutz expressed he does not believe there are any concerns\n    as there is      no through traffic and events occur on the weekends when that business is not open.\n    Alderman Clauss inquired how many additional parking spaces are being proposed, Mr. Marscheutz\n\n                                                                              2\n                                                           Board of Aldermen Committee Meeting,\n                                                                         June I, 2023\n\f\n         replied sixty-five (65) additional parallel parking spaces, fifteen (15) along the north portion and fifty\n         (50) along the east portion.\n\n         Aldennan Maserang shared he perceives as a shoulder improvement and is not opposed to request and\n         further inquired why it is not allowed to utilize adjacent business parking.                                                                                            City Administrator Nikki\n         Finkbiner replied shared parking is allowed under the Code with a written agreement from the property\n         owner.\n\n         Alderman Bereitschaft shared he is in favor of additional parking and suggested utilizing temporary\n         signs for parking during events.\n\n         City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner voiced after further review of graveled shoulder; she would deem\n         the request a shoulder improvement without concerns of swales being affected.\n\n         Sergeant Begley shared that he inspected the property and that he did not see concern for street parking\n         along the eastern portion ofHitzert Court but does have concern on the back northern portion of Hitzert\n         as it is not wide enough to allow for street parking unless that portion of Hitzert Court is widened.\n\n         Mayor Maurath inquired if approved and becomes an issue in future if the no parking prohibition could\n         be reinstated. City Attorney Erin Seele replied yes, as it is a police power not zoning.\n\n         Following discussion, Alderman Clauss made a motion to forward to the June Board of Aldennen\n         meeting the consideration of a request by STL Athletic Center to amend the Traffic Code to only allow\n         on street parking on front eastern portion of Hitzert Court. The motion was seconded by Alderman\n         Cruts. Upon a vote being taken, it was announced that the motion was unanimously passed by the\n         Committee.\n\nPERSONNEL -Aid Huels, Chairman (Wisbrock, Cruts, Jokers!}\n\nAldennan Huels made a motion to open topics to the full Board. The motion was seconded by Aldennan\nCruts. Upon                     a vote being taken, it was announced that the motion was unanimously passed by the\nCommittee.\n\n\u2022       Discussion regarding Annual Performance Evaluations.\n        Alderman Huels made a motion open topic to the full Board. The motion was seconded by Aldennan\n        Cruts. Upon a vote being taken, it was announced that the motion was unanimously passed by the\n        Committee.\n\n                                          th\n        At the April 6                         Board of Aldennen Committee Meeting, Staff was seeking direction for desired\n        changes. Aldennan Wisbrock made a motion to have each Alderman markup suggestions to proposed\n        Annual Performance Evaluations, return to Staff for revisions and continue topic to the June agenda.\n        The motion was seconded by Alderman Huels. To date, only one (1) suggestion was received:\n\n                 o        Non-supervisory: Not to remove \"Exceeds\" from Quality & Quantity of Work and Initiative\n                          categories only- as it allows an employee to attain a favorable rating if they do not perfonn as\n                          well in other areas.\n                 o        Supervisory: Not to remove \"Exceeds\" from                                                                Supervision & Leadership and Planning and\n                          Organizational Management categories only - as it allows an employee to attain a favorable\n                          rating if they do not perfonn as well in other areas.\n\n\n                                                                                                                              3\n                                                                                               Board of Aldennen Committee Meeting,\n                                                                                                                     June I, 2023\n\f\n            o     Incorporate        Responsibility         &    Initiative      into    Planning      and     Organizational          Management\n                  category.\n\n      City Clerk Jane Hungler shared that Mayor Maurath had shared that he wanted changes but did not\n      submit      any    suggestions and           Alderman         Clauss     submitted       that   she    would      like   to   leave     \"exceed\n      expectations\" in the evaluations. Staff is still seeking direction of desired changes.\n\n      Following discussion,              Alderman        Huels     continued       the    topic to allow         additional      time     for further\n      suggestions to be submitted.\n\n\u2022     Consideration of a job description for a Records Assistant Clerk.\n      The proposed job description for Records Assistant Clerk-City Hall, which this position would assist\n      the City Clerk in carrying out duties that are more narrowly focused on the recording, retention, and\n      communication of official City business, was available for review. The goal of this position is to\n      preserve the City's records and manage paperwork effectively by assisting to identify, scan, photocopy,\n      and     index     to   implement         computerized          document        retention      within      City    Hall    and     Community\n      Development. Based on the above, Staff is requesting that the Board approve this position as a Part-\n      Time position. The proposed pay range is a Level 7 ($31,373 - $38.663 - $45,953).\n\n      Mayor Maurath inquired about the transfer of management of RiverChase to the YMCA reducing\n      Human Resources time                 if it   helps reallocate time to              record     management.          He further        asked for\n      clarification that the request is for a part-time clerk and if there were any other current employees that\n      would assist. City Clerk Jane Hungler responded yes and that current employees are helping however\n      there are a massive number of documents that need to be scanned and indexed.\n\n      City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner shared there are companies that                                        provide document scanning\n      services. In recent discussion with a current vendor, their company also offers document management\n      software and Staff has an upcoming meeting with them for further information.\n\n      Alderman Maserang inquired if document retention would include photos. City Administrator Nikki\n      Finkbiner replied yes.\n\n      Alderman        Harrell      inquired      if the     position      would      be    permanent        part-time       or   temporary.        City\n     Administrator Nikki Finkbiner replied with the number of documents the position would be a long-\n      lasting position.\n\n     Alderman Bereitschaft expressed he is in favor of using a document scanning contracted service if they\n     know what they are doing and not have to do a lot of training and oversight.\n\n     Following discussion, Alderman Huels continued the topic to the July agenda to allow Staff time to\n     gather additional on other programs, server, and software.\n\n\u2022    Consideration of a job description                        for an      Administrative Assistant                 position      for   Parks      and\n     Recreation.\n     In June of 2022, consideration of a proposed position for Administrative Assistant-Sports and Rentals\n     was continued but was to be brought back at a later date for further discussion. The proposed job\n     description was available for review. This position would assist the Recreation Supervisor in carrying\n     out certain duties. It was noted that during the active season in the parks (March-October), the Parks\n     and Recreation Supervisors duties are heavily focused on the programming activities and rentals in the\n     park, leaving little to no time to develop and implement events in the park as desired by the City.\n\n\n                                                                                   4\n                                                              Board of Aldennen Committee Meeting,\n                                                                             June I, 2023\n\f\nBased on the above, Staff is requesting that the Board minimally approve this position as a Part-Time\nposition or a Flex position (due to the additional demand during the spring, summer, and fall months).\nBelow provides infonnation regarding the differences between Part-Time and Flex Employees.\n\n      FLEX EMPLOYEES: Employees who are approved by budget and may have multiple, concurrent\n      appointments as these Employees may be scheduled sporadically or may provide their available\n      hours to work on a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly basis and may work on average less than thirty\n      (30) hours per workweek or one hundred thirty (130) hours during a month and may not work more\n      than one thousand one hundred and seventy ( l, 170) hours per calendar year or more than nine (9)\n      consecutive months. Flex Employees are not eligible for benefits. Flex Employees shall reflect an\n      active status on the City's payroll within a six (6) month period. Flex Employees may be eligible\n      to receive pay increases based on City policy.\n\n      PART-TIME EMPLOYEES: Employees who are budgeted and regularly scheduled to work at least\n      twenty-four (24) hours, but less than twenty-eight point eight (28.8) hours in a normal work week\n      (Sunday through Saturday). Part-Time Employees may not work more than one thousand four\n      hundred ninety-nine (1,499) hours per calendar year. Part-Time Employees are eligible to accrue\n      Paid Time Off and holiday time on a pro-rated basis but are not eligible for benefits offered to Full-\n      Time Employees by the City.\n\nThe proposed pay range is a Level 3 ($14.46/$17.36/$20.25), but with a starting pay of $15. A copy of\nthe Parks and Recreation Supervisor job description was available for review also.\n\nPublic Works Director Dan Howard shared now that the current Recreation Supervisor has been in his\nposition for almost a year, and he is struggling to keep up with all his duties - adult leagues, youth\nsports leagues, the sports complex, rentals - both fields and shelters and a high number ofquestions via\nphone calls and email. He fields approximately seventy-five percent (75%) ofthe incoming calls to the\npublic works department.\n\nAldennan Bereitschaft inquired if turning over management of the concession stands freed up time for\nhim. Public Works Director Dan Howard responded it will help but his workload is still very heavy.\nCity Hall      is assisting in overseeing the Fanners'                  Market that is under his supervision.                 He   has very\nlimited time to coordinate events in the park.\n\nAldennan Maserang inquired if position would be spring and summer or year-round. Public Works\nDirector Dan Howard replied main workload would be spring, summer, fall, but there are year round\nprograms that take place, and there is plenty of work that needs to be done for either. City Administrator\nNikki Finkbiner explained the difference between Flex and Part-Time employees and further shared\nthat the Recreation Supervisor is currently working approximately seventy (70) hours per week.\n\nMayor Maurath shared he believes the number of hours he is currently working is due to concession\nstand. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner shared it is also due to the number of hours he is working\nthe ball fields. Mayor Maurath asked for a list of what he has been doing and what he is working on to\nunderstand what is going on. Mayor Maurath further stated that he feels people need to submit their\napplications online not via phone or email. Public Works Director Dan Howard stated applications for\nprograms and rentals are submitted online, however there are additional questions that people have.\nThe Public Works Administrative Assistant is helping answer calls and emails but there are more that\nneed to be responded to and he has reschedules for rainouts, etc. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner\nshared when the Recreation Supervisors were under Parks and Recreation Department this position was\nperfonned under two (2) separate job descriptions, one for sports/rentals and one for events. The risk\nto not consider additional help is not being able to offer park events the Board desires.\n\n                                                                           5\n                                                       Board of Aldermen Committee Meeting,\n                                                                      June I, 2023\n\f\n         Following discussion, Alderman Huels made a motion to forward to the June Board of Aldermen\n         meeting the consideration of a job description for an Administrative Assistant position for Parks and\n         Recreation and obtain a list of duties the Recreation Supervisor in doing and working on. The motion\n         was seconded by Alderman Clauss. Upon a vote being taken, it was announced that the motion was\n         unanimously passed by the Committee.\n\nCOMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND AFFAIRS - Aid.

City\n        Administrator Nikki Finkbiner explained the quotes were obtained as an estimate with specifications\n        to see if the Board had a desire to move forward with the project to go out for formal bid.\n\n        Alderman Harrell shared after consideration he is feels the large expense for a digital sign may not be\n        productive and is in favor of a new simple non digital sign. Alderman Harrell inquired if notices could\n        be      distributed through Nixie as                                            more people utilize their phones vs                                                      driving past City Hall.                                  City\n        Administrator Nikki Finkbiner replied yes.\n\n        Alderman Clauss inquired if a daily car count was known in front of City Hall with the number of\n        citizens going to St. Paul Church/School. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner replied no.\n\n        Alderman Maserang agreed a new sign is needed but does not feel a digital sign would be effective.\n        Alderman Cruts                            inquired on going out to bid                                               for      both digital                   and        non-digital                  signs         for      further\n        consideration. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner suggested consideration of quotes for a sign that\n        could be integrated to digital in the future should the Board reconsider.\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                    6\n                                                                                                   Board of Aldermen Committee Meeting,\n                                                                                                                           June I, 2023\n\f\n      Mayor Maurath shared he feels the $68,000 for the RiverChase electronic sign was not utilized as it\n      should have been and agrees with Alderman Harrell and Alderman Maserang to replace current sign\n      with a simple sign.\n\n      Alderman Maserang inquired on frequency of accidents at the intersection in front of City Hall.\n      Sergeant Begley responded he could perform a study, however that intersection is unincorporated St.\n      Louis County.\n\n      Following        discussion,        Alderman         Bereitschaft        made      a   motion       to   have     Staff obtain         additional\n      information and pricing on non-digital signage in front of City Hall.

Clauss, Chairman (Cruts, Harrell, Jokerst)\nConsideration of a request by STL Athletic Center to amend the Traffic Code to allow parking on Hitzert Court.\nMichael Marscheutz of STL Athletic Center, located at 2300 Hitzert Court, is requesting an amendment to the Code to allow parking along Hitzert Court, which is not permitted at any time under Schedule VIII of the City's Traffic Code.\n\nSTL Athletic Center received approval of a Special Use Permit (SUP) to operate an Indoor Unlimited Recreational Facility under Ordinance 3907, as amended by Ordinance 4213, with a condition that, \"the parking on-site shall be/remain sufficient for the use of the property.\" Recently, large events (gun shows, sneaker events) have been held at this location where on-site parking has not been sufficient for the use, putting their SUP at risk of being revoked.\n\nMike Marscheutz, 2300 Hitzert Court, Fenton MO 63026 shared a presentation overview outlining his request for additional parking (attached as part of the minutes). He is proposing parallel parking spaces on the shoulder of Hitzert Court on both sides of his building, of which Hitzert Court is owned by STL Athletic. Additional parking would only be utilized for big events (4-6 per year) when there are slow times of his business. Currently, he is using the neighboring business parking lot with verbal authorization of the tenant, which is not allowed under the City Code. STL Athletic proposes to pave and stripe the gravel shoulder in the next year if the proposal is approved.\n\nMr. Marscheutz shared Hitzert Court is very wide to help facilitate truck traffic, approximately forty feet (40') wide in some areas not including the shoulder. He feels he could maintain parallel parking with a pedestrian walkway.\n\nMayor Maurath inquired if more parking spaces could be created on the back side of the building and if the City has ability to regulate private street parking. City Attorney Erin Seele replied yes for safety reasons.\n\nCity Administrator Nikki Finkbiner noted there could be concerns with swales in Metropolitan Sewer District (MSD) right-of-way due to additional impervious surfaces. She further shared a typical street is twenty-six feet (26') wide within a fifty-foot (50') right-of-way. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner shared the Fenton Fire Protection District (FFPD) stated they do not have concerns of parking along the eastern part of Hitzert Court with the width of the road. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner expressed concerns that if striped it may be deemed a parking lot not an access way placing it under a different Code. She suggested it not be striped and deemed on street parking.\n\nCity Administrator Nikki Finkbiner has discussed with Mr. Marscheutz that he needs to review the existing access easement agreements on the property, minimally with the property to the north (lot B), to determine if this parking may cause any violations of same.\n\nAlderman Clauss inquired on concerns of parked cars being hit by trucks entering and exiting docking facilities located across the street. Mr. Marscheutz expressed he does not believe there are any concerns as there is no through traffic and events occur on the weekends when that business is not open. Alderman Clauss inquired how many additional parking spaces are being proposed, Mr. Marscheutz replied sixty-five (65) additional parallel parking spaces, fifteen (15) along the north portion and fifty (50) along the east portion.\n\nAlderman Maserang shared he perceives it as a shoulder improvement and is not opposed to the request and further inquired why it is not allowed to utilize adjacent business parking. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner replied shared parking is allowed under the Code with a written agreement from the property owner.\n\nAlderman Bereitschaft shared he is in favor of additional parking and suggested utilizing temporary signs for parking during events.\n\nCity Administrator Nikki Finkbiner voiced after further review of the graveled shoulder; she would deem the request a shoulder improvement without concerns of swales being affected.\n\nSergeant Begley shared that he inspected the property and that he did not see concern for street parking along the eastern portion of Hitzert Court but does have concern on the back northern portion of Hitzert as it is not wide enough to allow for street parking unless that portion of Hitzert Court is widened.\n\nMayor Maurath inquired if approved and becomes an issue in future if the no parking prohibition could be reinstated. City Attorney Erin Seele replied yes, as it is a police power not zoning.\n\nFollowing discussion, Alderman Clauss made a motion to forward to the June Board of Aldermen meeting the consideration of a request by STL Athletic Center to amend the Traffic Code to only allow on-street parking on the front eastern portion of Hitzert Court. The motion was seconded by Alderman Cruts. Upon a vote being taken, it was announced that the motion was unanimously passed by the Committee.\n\nPERSONNEL - Aid Huels, Chairman (Wisbrock, Cruts, Jokerst)\nAlderman Huels made a motion to open topics to the full Board. The motion was seconded by Alderman Cruts. Upon a vote being taken, it was announced that the motion was unanimously passed by the Committee.\n\nDiscussion regarding Annual Performance Evaluations.\nAlderman Huels made a motion to open the topic to the full Board. The motion was seconded by Alderman Cruts. Upon a vote being taken, it was announced that the motion was unanimously passed by the Committee.\n\nAt the April 6 Board of Aldermen Committee Meeting, Staff was seeking direction for desired changes. Alderman Wisbrock made a motion to have each Alderman markup suggestions to proposed Annual Performance Evaluations, return to Staff for revisions, and continue the topic to the June agenda. The motion was seconded by Alderman Huels. To date, only one (1) suggestion was received:\n\n          o Non-supervisory: Not to remove \"Exceeds\" from Quality & Quantity of Work and Initiative categories only - as it allows an employee to attain a favorable rating if they do not perform as well in other areas.\n          o Supervisory: Not to remove \"Exceeds\" from Supervision & Leadership and Planning and Organizational Management categories only - as it allows an employee to attain a favorable rating if they do not perform as well in other areas. \n\n          o Incorporate Responsibility & Initiative into Planning and Organizational Management category.\n\nCity Clerk Jane Hungler shared that Mayor Maurath had shared that he wanted changes but did not submit any suggestions and Alderman Clauss submitted that she would like to leave \"exceed expectations\" in the evaluations. Staff is still seeking direction of desired changes.\n\nFollowing discussion, Alderman Huels continued the topic to allow additional time for further suggestions to be submitted.\n\nConsideration of a job description for a Records Assistant Clerk.\nThe proposed job description for Records Assistant Clerk-City Hall, which this position would assist the City Clerk in carrying out duties that are more narrowly focused on the recording, retention, and communication of official City business, was available for review. The goal of this position is to preserve the City's records and manage paperwork effectively by assisting to identify, scan, photocopy, and index to implement computerized document retention within City Hall and Community Development. Based on the above, Staff is requesting that the Board approve this position as a Part-Time position. The proposed pay range is a Level 7 ($31,373 - $38.663 - $45,953).\n\nMayor Maurath inquired about the transfer of management of RiverChase to the YMCA reducing Human Resources time if it helps reallocate time to record management. He further asked for clarification that the request is for a part-time clerk and if there were any other current employees that would assist. City Clerk Jane Hungler responded yes and that current employees are helping however there are a massive number of documents that need to be scanned and indexed.\n\nCity Administrator Nikki Finkbiner shared there are companies that provide document scanning services. In a recent discussion with a current vendor, their company also offers document management software and Staff has an upcoming meeting with them for further information.\n\nAlderman Maserang inquired if document retention would include photos. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner replied yes.\n\nAlderman Harrell inquired if the position would be permanent part-time or temporary. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner replied with the number of documents the position would be a long-lasting position.\n\nAlderman Bereitschaft expressed he is in favor of using a document scanning contracted service if they know what they are doing and not have to do a lot of training and oversight.\n\nFollowing discussion, Alderman Huels continued the topic to the July agenda to allow Staff time to gather additional information on other programs, servers, and software.\n\nConsideration of a job description for an Administrative Assistant position for Parks and Recreation.\nIn June of 2022, consideration of a proposed position for Administrative Assistant-Sports and Rentals was continued but was to be brought back at a later date for further discussion. The proposed job description was available for review. This position would assist the Recreation Supervisor in carrying out certain duties. It was noted that during the active season in the parks (March-October), the Parks and Recreation Supervisors duties are heavily focused on the programming activities and rentals in the park, leaving little to no time to develop and implement events in the park as desired by the City.\n\nBased on the above, Staff is requesting that the Board minimally approve this position as a Part-Time position or a Flex position (due to the additional demand during the spring, summer, and fall months). Below provides information regarding the differences between Part-Time and Flex Employees.\n\n      FLEX EMPLOYEES: Employees who are approved by the budget and may have multiple, concurrent appointments as these Employees may be scheduled sporadically or may provide their available hours to work on a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly basis and may work on average less than thirty (30) hours per workweek or one hundred thirty (130) hours during a month and may not work more than one thousand one hundred seventy (1,170) hours per calendar year or more than nine (9) consecutive months. Flex Employees are not eligible for benefits. Flex Employees shall reflect an active status on the City's payroll within a six (6) month period. Flex Employees may be eligible to receive pay increases based on City policy.\n\n      PART-TIME EMPLOYEES: Employees who are budgeted and regularly scheduled to work at least twenty-four (24) hours, but less than twenty-eight point eight (28.8) hours in a normal work week (Sunday through Saturday). Part-Time Employees may not work more than one thousand four hundred ninety-nine (1,499) hours per calendar year. Part-Time Employees are eligible to accrue Paid Time Off and holiday time on a pro-rated basis but are not eligible for benefits offered to Full-Time Employees by the City.\n\nThe proposed pay range is a Level 3 ($14.46/$17.36/$20.25), but with a starting pay of $15. A copy of the Parks and Recreation Supervisor job description was available for review also.\n\nPublic Works Director Dan Howard shared now that the current Recreation Supervisor has been in his position for almost a year, and he is struggling to keep up with all his duties - adult leagues, youth sports leagues, the sports complex, rentals - both fields and shelters, and a high number of questions via phone calls and email. He fields approximately seventy-five percent (75%) of the incoming calls to the public works department.\n\nAlderman Bereitschaft inquired if turning over management of the concession stands freed up time for him. Public Works Director Dan Howard responded it will help but his workload is still very heavy. City Hall is assisting in overseeing the Farmers' Market that is under his supervision. He has very limited time to coordinate events in the park.\n\nAlderman Maserang inquired if the position would be spring and summer or year-round. Public Works Director Dan Howard replied the main workload would be spring, summer, fall, but there are year-round programs that take place, and there is plenty of work that needs to be done for either. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner explained the difference between Flex and Part-Time employees and further shared that the Recreation Supervisor is currently working approximately seventy (70) hours per week.\n\nMayor Maurath shared he believes the number of hours he is currently working is due to concession stand. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner shared it is also due to the number of hours he is working at the ball fields. Mayor Maurath asked for a list of what he has been doing and what he is working on to understand what is going on. Mayor Maurath further stated that he feels people need to submit their applications online not via phone or email. Public Works Director Dan Howard stated applications for programs and rentals are submitted online, however, there are additional questions that people have. The Public Works Administrative Assistant is helping answer calls and emails but there are more that need to be responded to and he has reschedules for rainouts, etc. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner shared when the Recreation Supervisors were under the Parks and Recreation Department this position was performed under two (2) separate job descriptions, one for sports/rentals and one for events.
