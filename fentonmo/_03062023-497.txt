OLD BUSINESS:
•   Discussion regarding replacement of picnic tables in the parks.
    Staff has completed the inventory of the picnic tables within the City's park system. Currently, there
    are five (5) tables at Westside Park, six (6) at each shelter at Bud Weil Park, three (3) wood and two
    (2) metal at Valiant Park, nine (9) at Hitzert Pavilion, eight (8) at Shelter l and ten (IO) at Shelter 2.
    Hitzert and Shelter I Pavilions will each have ten (10) tables prior to the start of the rental season. A
    total of fifteen ( 15) tables were identified as needing to be replaced due to rust and deterioration on
    the frame possibly caused from continued dragging over the concrete slabs.                        Additionally, the City
    needs ten (10) more tables for the new Meramec Pavilion.

                                              Parks and Recreation Committee Meeting
                                                          March 6, 2023

                                                                                  th
          As discussed at the February 6                                               Parks and Recreation Committee Meeting, Staff has looked into the
          cost to purchase new tables for the shelters including the new Meramec Inn shelter. New wooden
          tables, similar to what the City currently has, range in price from $700-$900. Thermo plastic or vinyl
          type metal coated tables range                                              in price for $950 - $1200. The coated metal tables can be higher
          depending on the type of coating.

         Based on the above, Staff is requesting to purchase a minimum of twenty (20) coated metal tables.
         Ten (10) for the new Meramec Inn Pavilion and ten (10) to replace replacements the tables at the
          Hitzert Pavilion.                        Replacement of all tables to the metal coated type would occur in subsequent years.
         Public Works does have some recently "rebuilt" tables that will be used to replace the remaining five
         (5) tables of the fifteen (15) identified to be replaced as noted above until future replacement occurs.

         In order to purchase the initial twenty (20) coated metal tables, Staff is requesting a budget of $25,000
         be added to the 2023 budget.

         The reason                    for       the       request of the                       coated metal                      is     the       longevity               of the            tables with                   little       to     no
         maintenance and will be fastened to the concrete. Currently, on a yearly basis, Staff must replace
         rotted or damaged wood planks, paint the surface, and                                                                                  is consistently removing staples placed by
         people renting or using the pavilions.

         After discussion, Audrey Wattler made a motion to approve the purchase of the initial twenty (20)
         coated metal tables and request a budget of $25,000 be added to the 2023                                                                                                                 budget. Lynn Hughes
         seconded the motion.

•        Discussion regarding a bathroom in Fabick Nature Preserve.
                                                               th
         During the February 6                                       Meeting, the Parks and Recreation Committee requested that Staff gather
         additional information regarding options for a restroom at Fabick Nature Preserve, specifically a cost
         estimate for a prefabricated structure.

         As discussed in February, two (2) options are:
         ( 1) Build a new bathroom facility similar to the existing restroom in Valiant Park. The cost estimate,
                   including contingencies, was $190,000.

         (2) Erect a prefabricated structure, similar to those located at Mini Ha Ha Park in Sunset Hills, but
                  with sewer, water, and electricity. Staff was to obtain pricing options on these types of structures;
                  however, Staff has not received a response from the manufacturer. It is                                                                                                         noted that per Sunset
                  Hills, the units at Mini Ha Ha cost approximately $85,000, but the structures were purchased in
                  2006. Staff is still working to obtain current pricing from the manufacturer and will forward the
                  same to the Commission as soon as they are available.

         In addition to the above, it was requested by some members of the Board that Staff review the cost to
         rehab the existing bathroom structure at the Fabick Nature Preserve, as this option may be more cost
        effective. A list of needed improvements that will most likely need to occur has been created and
         Staff is seeking estimates from contractors (sewer/plumbing, electrical, and carpentry); however, as of
         the date of this memo, these estimates have not been received. It is also noted by Staff, that should a
         rehab of the facility occur in lieu of a new structure, the bathroom will also need to be improved for
         ADA compliance.


                                                                                                                         2

          bathroom in Fabick Nature Preserve.

•        Discussion regarding the use of the former greenhouse area in the Fabick Nature Preserve.
                                                                th
          During the February 6                                      Meeting, the Parks and Recreation Committee requested that Staff gather
         additional information regarding improvements/uses for the former greenhouse area in the Fabick
         Nature Preserve (where the new or rehabbed bathroom will be located).

         Staff requests that this discussion be continued                                                                      until a decision is made                                      regarding the bathroom
          improvements.

         After discussion, topic to be continued to allow Staff needed time to provide additional information
         regarding the use of the former greenhouse area in the Fabick Nature Preserve.

         •        Approval ofgrading of tl,e former house foundation area in Fabick Nature Preserve.
         ■
                  Public Works Director Dan Howard explained in years past the Fabick house was removed and
                  chain-link was installed for safety. Over the years the fence has degraded and foundation walls
                  are failing.                 He is requesting approval to re-grade the area to address any safety concerns and
                  graffiti issues.

                  Alderman Jokers! expressed she was in favor putting money toward keeping and preserving the
                  stone          walls.           She further                    inquired if this                         would be                 performed in-house                                 or contracted,                       with
                  concerns of staff shortages and other numerous                                                                           City projects that need to be completed,                                                               if
                 performed                    in-house.               Public             Works            Director                Dan          Howard stated he                                wanted discussion for
                  consideration of the project and that some of the work would need to be contracted out if the
                 project would be approved.

                 Alderman                   Wisbrock shared that during discussion                                                               at the            Parks            and Recreation                          Committee

                  meeting on February 6                                   , this project is in conjunction with the discussion ofproject for the use of
                  the former greenhouse area in                                                  Fabick Nature                         Preserve,                which would include                                  the proposed
                  bathrooms. The fill material from that area, to create additional parking and possible additional
                 amenities, would be used in the re-grade of the house foundation to create a maintainable slope.
                 Alderman Maserang voiced he feels ift here is a safety hazard concern, it needs to be addressed.

                 Mayor Maurath expressed if walls removed, re-graded; maybe benches could be installed in the
                flat area if not sloped in re-grade. He feels if the project is approved it should be contracted out
                 as well as the deficiencies at the Beckman (Bud Weil Annex) property at the same time. Mayor
                 Maurath                 voiced concerns                             of installing playground                                        in      Fabick             Nature              Preserve                 with         deed
                 restrictions.

            After discussion. Alderman Huels made a final motion to take discussion ofgrading ofthe former
            house foundation area in Fabick Nature Preserve back to the Parks and Recreation Committee
            for   more      detailed information             and plan        for   the   whole      area.    The     motion      was seconded by
            Alderman Wisbrock.              Upon a vote being taken. the motion passed unanimously by the Board of
            Aldermen.

      Based on the above, the Board is seeking direction from the Parks and Recreation Committee for
      ideas of the area.

      Alderman Huels reminded the Committee the property is deed restricted and also the Board is seeking
      a better clarification of the projects in the Fabick area as a whole.

      Mary Heinemann shared she feels this project is a large expense, with minimal foot traffic and is a
      legacy area and is unsure of changing the whole area.

      Mike Abbott expressed he would like to see large trees that line the stone wall retained, and further
      expressed the stone wall is deteriorating. He shared there are two (2) former foundations areas that
      could be considered to be filled in to start the project.

      Public Works Director Dan Howard shared the chain link fence that along the rock wall needs to be
      replaced or removed and grade the area to remove drop offs.

      After discussion, Gary Johnson made a motion to continue the topic to allow Staff needed time to
      evaluate hazards          at the former          house foundation are in Fabick Nature Preserve. Audrey Wattler
      seconded the motion.

•    Discussion regarding proposed Great River Greenway Signage along the Meramec Greenway
     Trail.
     Great Rivers Greenway is in the process of updating/replacing signage along the Meramec Greenway
     and     Angelica       Gutierrez,       Project     Manager        with     Great     River     Greenway         provided       a   presentation
     regarding the project.

     Ms. Gutierrez stated they are proposing removing and upgrading signage along the Greenway, bridge
     graphics, "sticks", coordinating with Public Works Director Dan Howard for ADA improvements to
     provide the Greenway through Olde Towne district that does not run along the river road and St.
     Louis County Parks for connection with George Winter Park, MoDOT to create a vertical separation
     at the 1-44 bridge and working on agreements for that work.

     Gary Johnson expressed he would like to signage to be consistent with City signage and inquired if
     there would be more signs installed than what is current. Ms. Gutierrez replied there are thirty (30)
     Greenway signs to be removed and forty-two ( 42) signs to be installed.

     Mike Abbott expressed he does not want the "sticks" to district from City signage. Ms. Gutierrez
     shared the "sticks" would not be located near City signs. Mary Heinemann, Lynn Huges, and Mike
     Abbott expressed they like the "sticks".

     Mary Heinemann shared she likes the proposed graphics for the pillars. Mike Abbott suggested

       Construction Grants - (Municipal Park Grant Commission) - Since the Municipal Park Grant
       Commission of St.             Louis County was formed                   in 2000, it      has awarded over $71                million in grant
       money to municipalities in St. Louis County.

       The grants have been used to fund park renovations and explanation projects including; playgrounds,
       water parks, golf courses, trails, recreation centers,                          ice rinks and many other types of recreation
       facilities.

       This money is awarded to municipalities based on the strength of their grant applications, taking into
       account such factors as need, planning, community input, and prior awards.

      Planning         Grants       - (Municipal           Park     Grant       Commission)            - This      program       awards      grants     to
       municipalities in order to help plan future parks and recreation projects. Unlike the implementation
      grants, planning grants must be met by a 20% match by the municipality, and cannot exceed an award
      amount of $10,000.

      The Planning Grant may be used to:
               1)   review existing park facilities to determine equipment and replacement needs;
              2)    to determine the need for additional facilities                         and/or equipment needs within an exiting
                    park; or
              3)    evaluate the development of a new park.

      Staff understands that there is                 not a lack of funding opportunities; however, projects selected for
      application need to have the best chance of being selected for funding during the competitive grant
      process.

      City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner shared                          in 2018, a planning grant was put together for Fabick
      Nature Preserve that was not brought forward for review. Mary Heinemann inquired if the 2018 plan
      that was never enacted could be utilized and moved forward. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner
      replied will need to clarify where the 2018 plan was left and will also need to consider if an overall
      plan for the parks is desired or a small focused plan.                          Mike Abbott suggested consider including Bud
      Weil Annex property.

      Lynn      Hughes        inquired      if repaving         trails    could     be    a   consideration         of a      grant     project.     City
      Administrator Nikki Finkbiner replied yes, under amenities.

      To have a better understanding of the eligible grants reviewed this month and last, Staff will compile
      a list    of grants       and    timeframes         for   application,       along     with     eligibility     for   each     grant,    and     the
      Commission can then select projects to be forwarded to the Board for approval.

•     Selection of a date for annual Parks and Recreation Committee training with the City Attorney.

      The annual Parks and Recreation Committee Training will not be held until after the appointment of
      Committee Members to vacant seats.
