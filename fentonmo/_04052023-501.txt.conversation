The Property       is zoned    \"CP-1\"     Commercial\n             Park District.\n\n             City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner gave a summary of the Staff report to the Commission. A\n             copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department. She explained\n             that the   Petitioner is    proposing     a 35,600    square-foot     building   addition    to the   existing   truck\n             terminal that would provide additional dock doors at the facility. The Petitioner is also proposing\n             an expansion of the parking lot along             with the    building addition and noted that the           existing\n             parking lot encroaches the front Buffer Areas which requires a variance before the parking lot can\n             be expanded. The Petitioner has applied for the necessary variance.\n\n             Doug Tiemann, representative for the Petitioner, approached. He explained that along with the\n             building addition and parking lot improvements, underground detention areas for stormwater will\n             be provided. Concerns were brought up by the Commission about the increase in traffic in the\n             area that additional dock doors might cause. The City Administrator Finkbiner commented that\n             traffic concerns could be reviewed under the Special Use Permit request under Case 2023-SUP-07\n             submitted along with the Site Plan Review.\n\n             Chairperson Yeoman made a motion to move Case 2023-SUP-07 up on the agenda and to hear\n             Case    2023-SUP-07        in   conjunction      with    2023-SPR-01.        The    motion     was    seconded      by\n             Commissioner Nelson. The motion was unanimously passed by voice vote.\n\n            CASE 2023-SUP-07: A Petition by Estes Trucking for a Special Use Permit to operate a\n            Truck Terminal at 205 Soccer Park Road. The property is zoned \"CP-1\" Commercial Park\n            District.\n\n            The City Administrator explained that that the truck terminal has been in operation since 1989\n            and under the new Zoning Code it now requires a Special Use Permit. The use is a legal non-\n            conforming use and needs approval of the SUP before Site Plan Review can be approved.\n\n            Additional discussion was held about potential traffic congestion, the need for a traffic study, and\n            other similar uses in the area. The Petitioner added that the additional dock doors would allow the\n            trucks to be pre-loaded at the docks so there is no wait time for the drivers.\n\f\nPlanning and Zoning Commission Meeting                                                                                                   Page3\nApril 5, 2023\n\n                Following discussion, Chairperson Yeoman read aloud the conditions of approval for Case 2023-\n                SPR-01.
