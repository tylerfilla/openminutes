     OLD BUSINESS:

                 CASE 2023-SUP-11: A Petition by Corbin Holtzman on behalf of Talaria MO, LLC for a Special
                 Use Permit to operate a Marijuana Transportation Facility at 2275 Cassens Drive, Suite 130. The
                 parcel is addressed as 143 Cassens Court and is zoned "IP-1" Industrial Park District.

                 Community Development Director Amy Starck reminded the Commission that this case was continued
                 from     the   August meeting so that additional                      information about the              operation of the business could                   be
                 provided. She commented that the tenant submitted information to address the Commissions concerns, and
                 the standards in the Code for Transportation Facilities, noting that many of the requirements exceed state
                 regulations.        She also noted that while lab testing was mentioned at the last meeting, it was confirmed by
                 the applicant that this facility will not have a lab.

                 The Petitioners, Corbin Holtzman,                     property owner, and Ryan                   Smith of Talaria approached.                  Mr.    Smith
                 summarized the operation explaining that they are a secure logistics company operating in 27 states that
                 does business to business transport of sealed marijuana. Mr. Smith added that they have an existing license
                 in the     State    of Missouri        and     are   looking to       relocate to        Fenton.     He    explained that the company uses
                 unmarked vans for discretion and the building will not have signage. He also explained that 100% of the
                 product that applicant receives                 is sealed and nothing is visible from                     outside the facility.          In response to
                 questions from the Commission, Mr. Smith explained that the facility is not a storage facility, but product
                 may be temporarily held on-site within a secure room when deliveries cannot be made within a work day,
                 but state requirements do not allow product to held for more than 72 hours.

                 Mr.   Smith explained that security for the facility's                         operation includes continuous monitoring to, comply
                with state regulations. There are always two (2) cameras on the product including in the building and on
                the van at all times. A door is being added to the facility to allow vans to drive into the building so that any
                transfer of product between vehicles occurs internally in secured areas. He added that all employees have
                gone through background checks with the vast majority of the employees being retired law enforcement
                officers. The building hours will be 7am to 5pm and because of the layers of security, will only need to be
                staffed during those hours. To address traffic concerns, Mr. Smith stated the number of vans in and out
                will be 5 to 10 at the beginning, but they see it rising to about 20 to 3 0 a day as they grow.

                Mayor       Maurath        thanked       the    applicant       for   the    additional       information        and     stated     he   was     sorry     the
                Commission did not have it last month.                        He also noted for the record that the applicant is required to have
                certain certifications by the state and confirmed those certifications are or will be in place.

                The Commission queried the Petitioner about the transport of money as that was mentioned during the
                previous month's discussion. Mr. Smith answered that cash logistics will be handled by a separate business
                and at no time does money and product co-mingle.

    NEW BUSINESS:

                CASE        2023-SUP-12:            A   Petition      by    Abier      Mseitef of S&H              Spirit,     Inc.    dba    Fenton       Liquor       and
                Tobacco for a Special Use Permit to operate a Liquor Store and Tobacco Shop at 645 Gravois Road.
                The property is zoned "OT-2" Olde Towne District.

                Community Development Director Amy Starck gave a summary of the Staff report to the Commission. A
                copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department. She explained that a SUP
                was approved in April for Stars Liquor and Tobacco; however, the Petitioner recently established a new
                corporate entity and business name. Additionally, the Board approved a text amendment in May to add
                Tobacco Shops to the Code as a Use that now requires a SUP in "OT-2". Since Special Use Permits are
                non-transferrable, and a SUP is now needed for Tobacco Shops, the Petitioner is seeking a new SUP. No
                changes to the operation of the business are proposed.

                The Petitioner, Abier Mseitif, approached. There were no questions for the Petitioner.

                Chairperson Yeoman read aloud the conditions of approval. The Petitioner agreed to all.

                Conditions of Approval:
                      I.    Approval of the Special Use Permit is for                         S&H Spirit, Inc. dba Fenton Liquor and Tobacco to
                            operate      a Liquor        Store    at   645     Gravois      Road,' as       indicated       on   the    plans     provided       with    the
                            application and dated July 25, 2023.
                      2.    Compliance with all other applicable City of Fenton Codes and Ordinances

                 CASE 2023-SUP-13: A Petition by L and R Group Corp. for a Special Use Permit to operate an
                 Indoor Limited Recreational Facility at 2045 Hitzert Court. The property is zoned "IP-1" Industrial
                 Park District.

                 Community Development Director Amy Starck gave a summary of the Staff report to the Commission. A
                 copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department.

                 The Petitioners, Laura and Rob Powers approached. The Petitioners explained that they are proposing a
                 basketball franchise.            It is   an   emerging       brand with 30           around      the Country and one (1)                in   the   State of
                 Georgia. They will have shooting cages and skills stations that use geospatial technology to provide virtual
                 interactive      training.      They     will    also    have    former      professional        basketball       players     offering training          and
                 coaching       to   small     groups      of kids.       The     Petitioner explained            that    that   patrons      can    either    enroll     in a
                 membership program (monthly,                      bi-annually,       or annually) or pay by the hour.                    In   response to questions
                 about available parking, Mr. Powers stated that they only anticipate 12-15 kids at one time with most being
                 dropped off. Additionally, the hours will vary based on the season, with summer hours between 10am-8pm
                 and winter hours between 2pm-9pm. The Petitioner stated that industrial buildings are ideal for these types
                 of facilities      because they need             tall   ceilings,     and    most franchise          locations      are   also    in   industrial     areas.
                 Additionally, another recreational facility for batting cages is located in the adjacent building, so there are
                 no concerns with traffic.

                 Chairperson Yeoman read aloud the conditions of approval. The Petitioner agreed to all.

                 Conditions of Approval:
                       1.    This    Special      Use     Permit      is   solely    for    L   and     R   Group      Corp      to   operate      an   Indoor      Limited
                             Recreational Facility at 2045 Ritzert Court.
                       2.    Minimally, an Occupancy Permit will be required before the building is occupied.
                      3.     A separate Municipal Zoning Approval (MZA) by the City of Fenton for any proposed interior
                             remodel or proposed signage will be required.
                      4.     Compliance with all other applicable City of Fenton Codes and Ordinances.
