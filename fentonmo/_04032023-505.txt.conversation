He   inquired if Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC) has provided\n     information on       signage     available    and   further   inquired    if the signage was included            in approved\n     volunteer request       project forms.       Mike Abbott       stated   volunteers     planted    aquatic    plants this    past\n     weekend.\n\n     City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner replied she would follow up with MDC on signage available and\n     explained signage would need to be requested in the project when submitted.                              City Administrator\n     Nikki Finkbiner further noted that the plantings in the \"no mow\" section were not required to have\n     signage, but rather the Public Works Director asked that he be informed and to have the new planting\n     areas marked with flags so they could be mapped. There were no further questions or comments.\n\n\u2022    Discussion regarding grant opportunities for parks.\n     In February and March, the Parks and Recreation Committee discussed grant opportunities through\n     Missouri    Department of Conservation (MDC),                  Missouri     State Parks,      and   Municipal     Park Grant\n     Commission.        A table that outlines components of each grant was available for review (attached as\n     part of the minutes).         That table was used as a reference during discussion to determine which\n     grants/projects the Committee may be interested in recommending to the Board for approval.\n\n     Also a copy of the 2018 Master Park Plan for the Fabick Nature Preserve was available for review\n     (attached    as   part   of the    minutes).     That   plan    was    funded    through     the   Municipal      Park   Grant\n     Commission Planning Grant, however the Plan is a draft as it was not presented to the Committee for\n    a final review to forward to the Board for approval. However, the Committee can review the plan for\n    consideration of projects they would still like to move forward.\n\n    Mary Heinemann suggested utilizing the 2018 draft for consideration of projects as it already has\n    public desire input such as trails and a dock on the lake. Audrey Wattler shared the Parks and\n    Recreation Committee did review a first draft of the plan but had no further review of the plan and\n    she believes the desire of the plan was to keep Fabick Nature Preserve in its natural state, develop\n    trails and rest areas along the trails, and develop grass areas into natural praire and education areas.\n    Mike Abbott expressed he would like to see at least circular trails developed. Mary Heinemann noted\n    that page 26 of the plan has suggestions for trail development in the preserve that could be used for\n    consideration.      Audrey Wattler shared           that the 2018      plan was      designed     to stay    within the deed\n    restrictions of the Fabick property.\n\n    Gary Johnson inquired if there was any funding that had been received for execution of the plan.\n    Alderman Huels replied the only funds received was to create the plan.\n\n    Lynn Hughes inquired if the dock would be installed, could there be canoe rental on the lake. City\n    Administrator Nikki Finkbiner stated she would need to verify that would be an allowed use due to\n    CAP regulations.\n\n    City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner overviewd grants; a Missouri State Parks Recreational Trails\n    Program Grant (RTP) would help fund trail connections or trail restoration, a Municipal Park Grant\n    Commission planning grant would help fund to review the Bud Weil Annex for a master plan for\n\n                                                                 2\n                                               Parks and Recreation Committee Meeting\n                                                            April 3, 2023\n\f\n      development of that property or assesements done in other parks or items from the 2018 master plan\n      for Fabick Nature Preserve.\n\n      City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner explained the Board needs the Committees direction on what\n      specific items/projects they want to move forward to apply for grants.\n\n      Mike Abbott asked if the Board desired the Committee to consider applying for a grant for the Soccer\n      Field Lighting project. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner replied she will need to inquire if that\n      project would be eligible for a grant and further noted that type of grant is to provide opportunity for\n      low income and need base.\n\n     Audrey Wattler suggested consider the plan for Fabick Nature Preserve to develop trails and grass\n     areas into natural praire for grants.\n\n     City    Administrator       Nikki    Finkbiner     explained     Missouri     Department       of Conservation        (MDC)\n     Community Forestry Cost Share, City has used this grant in the past for tree inventory/tree removal of\n     dead or diseased trees.
