Per Flock at that time, renewal for another one-year\n            term for the twenty-one (21) LPRs would be at the same cost as 2022 at $2,500 per camera, for a total\n           of $52,500, but it was noted that at that time that the rates would increase to $3,000 at the next renewal\n           (2024). At that time, Flock offered the City the option to lock in the $2,500 with a 5-year renewal, but\n           the City opted to wait until closer to the next term to make that decision.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                  I\n            (Note: In February of2023, the Board also approved Ordinances 4301 to renew the agreement with\n           the Gravois Bluffs TDD and Flock for Licenses Plate Readers for another one-year term.)\n\n           Last week Staff was contacted by Flock stating that they are again offering a 5-year renewal at the\n           existing $2,500 cost per camera and any future cameras purchased during the 5-year term through the\n           end of 2023. They also stated that the City could opt for a 5-year renewal at $2,500 per camera, without\n           the price lock for new cameras, through June 30, 2024. If the City does not want to enter into a 5-year\n           agreement, the price for the cameras in 2024 will be $3,000 each or $63,000 total.\n\n           Lisa Dunn, Flock Safety Sales Manager, clarified this would lock in $2,500 cost per camera if the Board\n           would execute now for new five (5) year term agreement and includes option to add additional cameras\n           by year end at same cost per camera if executed by December 31, 2023. Or the Board can wait until the\n          current agreement is up for renewal discussions in March; if the agreement is five (5) years the cost\n           will stay at $2,500 per camera, but if additional cameras are added the cost of the new camera will be\n           $3,000 per camera. However, if the agreement is less than five (5) years at renewal the cost per camera\n          will increase to $3,000.\n\n          Alderman Cruts inquired if a new five (5) year agreement is executed could the number of cameras be\n          reduced and cost remain at $2,500 per camera, in consideration of agreement with Gravois Bluffs TDD\n          that reimburses expense of ten ( I 0) cameras. Ms. Dunn replied no, the numbers of cameras cannot be\n          reduced; however, an agreement could be two (2) separate agreements with concerns of Gravois Bluffs\n          TDD termination during the five (5) year term but noted the price of the cameras not under the 5-year\n          agreement would increase.\n\n          Alderman Wisbrock inquired if there was a standard out in agreement. City Attorney Erin Seele replied\n          the City signed their contract - however if there is                                                                                                                     a multi-year appropriation term that could be\n\n                                                                                                                                                                               2\n                                                                                                                                   Board of Aldennen Committee Meeting,\n                                                                                                                                                               October 5, 2023\n\f\n      implemented into the five (5) year agreement. Ms. Flock shared a redline version would need to be\n      submitted for their legal review.\n\n      Alderman Maserang asked Captain Lawson if Flock cameras have assisted in investigations. Captain\n      Lawson replied Flock have assisted in investigations, however he cannot recommend signing a five (5)\n      year agreement due to always evolving technology. Captain Lawson noted that he is inquiring what\n      systems other municipalities/agencies are utilizing.\n\n      City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner asked the Board if they were considering adding additional cameras\n      this year, if not the consideration of term length can be revisited at the renewal discussions in March.\n      After discussion, there was not a desire to add additional cameras at this time.\n\n      Discussion ensued regarding the concern of locking the City in for five (5) years without knowing if\n      technology would change.\n\n      Alderman Maserang inquired if upgrades and updates were an additional cost. Ms. Dunn replied\n      updates to the software are ongoing and part of the agreement. If the replacement of camera is needed\n      and covered under the terms and conditions, Flock subscription model will replace with same or\n      upgraded camera. Alderman Clauss confirmed that the City does have to pay for that replacement\n      camera and Ms. Dunn responded yes.\n\n      Ms. Dunn shared they are seeing other agencies either adding camaras and/or signing five (5) year\n     agreements that utilize Flock camera systems, mainly due to large networking and stated she could get\n     that list to the City.\n\n     Following discussion, Alderman Clauss made a motion to forward to the October Board of Aldermen\n     meeting the renewal for Flock Cameras. The motion was seconded by Alderman Cruts.\n\n     Alderman Cruts rescinded his second. Alderman Clauss rescinded her first.\n\n     Alderman Clauss suggested the topic be continued to the renewal discussions in March. There were no\n     objections.\n\n\u2756 Consideration ofa request to amend Schedule IV One-Way Streets and Alleys of the Municipal\n     Code to include Goode Drive.\n     Over the past few years, the City and the St. Louis County Police Department have received numerous\n     complaints about excessive cut through traffic on Goode Drive. The cut through traffic is primarily an\n     issue during the morning rush hour, from around 6:00 a.m. to around 8:00 p.m. Residents along the\n     street have concerns regarding cars driving at a high rate of speed, considering the pavement width is\n     only ten feet (l 0') wide.\n\n     Although the street has a sign indicating \"local traffic only\", enforcement of \"local traffic\" is difficult.\n     In conversation with a couple of police officers, it was suggested to limit the street to one-way traffic.\n     The one-way traffic would be delineated for traffic flow from Water Street southwest to Church Street.\n     With the majority of traffic in the morning traveling northeast on Goode Drive, attempting to beat\n     traffic traveling through the Olde Towne area, the one-way roadway would give the police more ability\n     to enforce the restricted traffic flow on Goode Drive.\n\n     If approved,         Schedule IV One-Way Streets and Alleys of the                                Municipal Code would need to be\n     amended to include Goode Drive. Also, the Public Works Department would install \"Do Not Enter\"\n     and \"One Way\" signs at the intersection ofGoode Drive and Church Street along with a sign indicating\n\n                                                                                     3\n                                                                Board ofAldermen Committee Meeting,\n                                                                             October 5, 2023\n\f\n           \"No Cut Through\" to Water Street at the intersection of Church Street and Main Street. \"One-Way\"\n           signs would also be placed at the intersection of Goode Drive at Water Street.\n\n           Alderman Cruts and Alderman Jokerst shared they would like to have the affected residents' input on\n           the consideration before moving forward with request.\n\n           Captain Lawson shared this request has been brought forward as result of complaints received from\n           residents in that neighborhood and the local traffic only sign is broad in definition to enforce. Public\n           Works Director Dan Howard shared he has received complaints from three (3) ofthe four (4) residents\n           that they are unable to get out oftheir driveways due to high volume of cut through traffic using Goode\n           Drive in the mornings. The road is only ten feet (1 0') wide which does not allow cars the ability to pass\n           each other.\n\n           Marlin Mackley, 509 Main Street, Fenton MO expressed he is in favor of one-way street, morning\n           traffic is heavy heading to Larkin Williams (the River Road), and he has had conversations with\n           residents on that street about the traffic issues. He further shared a con would be vehicles driving the\n           wrong way as he sometimes observes on Ferry Street.\n\n           Mayor Maurath inquired if Goode Drive is a sanctioned City street. Public Works Director Dan Howard\n           shared it is not within the terms however it is City property.\n\n          Captain Lawson shared if the drive is made one-way it would give police the ability to enforce the\n           restricted traffic flow and noted, if approved, warnings could be issued during grace period of the\n           implementation.\n\n          City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner shared a possible consideration could be to amend Section 340.290;\n           redefining vehicles prohibited from using streets designated for local traffic only.\n\n          Alderman Jokerst suggested that Mr. Mackley speak with the residents regarding consideration of one-\n          way street on Goode Drive, so that residents can gather thoughts for discussion.\n\n          After discussion,                             Alderman                   Clauss suggested to continue                                                 to the November Board of Aldermen\n          Committee meeting to allow Staff to gather more information and communicate with Goode Drive and\n          Dalton Hill residents. There were no objections.\n\nAlderman Bereitschaft made a motion to move Community Development and Affairs topic next on the\nagenda. The motion was seconded by Alderman Wisbrock. Upon a voice vote being taken, it was announced\nthat the motion was passed unanimously by the Board of Aldermen.\n\nCOMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND                                                                                  AFFAIRS - Aid Bereitschaft,                                                     Chairman (Harrell,                                  Clauss,\nMaserang)\n\u2756 Consideration of proposals for a new monument sign in front of City Hall.\n                                             th\n          At the July 13                          Committee Meeting, the Community Development and Affairs Committee approved\n          Staff seeking proposals for a new, non-digital sign for City Hall via a Request for Proposals (RFP).

Mr.\n         Behrens shared the cost decreased due to the lighting required with revision with standoff lettering,\n         acrylic, interior back lighting and noted background color changed to the top to reflect lighting better\n         option.\n\n         There was discussion of adding complete street address with street name or eliminating street numbers\n         and keeping only the logo for a cleaner look to the base.\n\n         Mayor Maurath stated his biggest concern was visibility and asked whether the sign would be visible\n         from 141.

He feels Department Heads need to note ifan employee exceeds expectations, but they need\n        to only determine if an employee is eligible or not eligible for an across-the-board increase.\n\n        Alderman Clauss shared she feels not all areas warrant an exceeds expectations, but some do, but to\n        warrant an exceeds expectations rating it must be done consistently. She feels it is not fair for an\n        employee who meets expectations to receive the same increase as an employee who consistently\n        exceeds.\n\n        Alderman Jokerst shared she is not sure she wants to eliminate numbers for guide/range for increases.\n        Alderman Wisbrock shared he feels Department Heads could be educated further on how to complete\n        the form.\n\n                                                                                                                              5\n                                                                                              Board of Aldermen Committee Meeting,\n                                                                                                                  October 5, 2023\n\f\n           Following discussion, Alderman Huels made a motion to forward to the October Board of Aldermen\n           meeting the Annual Performance Evaluations as proposed.

Per Flock at that time, renewal for another one-year term for the twenty-one (21) LPRs would be at the same cost as 2022 at $2,500 per camera, for a total of $52,500, but it was noted that at that time that the rates would increase to $3,000 at the next renewal (2024). At that time, Flock offered the City the option to lock in the $2,500 with a 5-year renewal, but the City opted to wait until closer to the next term to make that decision.\n(Note: In February of 2023, the Board also approved Ordinances 4301 to renew the agreement with the Gravois Bluffs TDD and Flock for Licenses Plate Readers for another one-year term.)\nLast week Staff was contacted by Flock stating that they are again offering a 5-year renewal at the existing $2,500 cost per camera and any future cameras purchased during the 5-year term through the end of 2023. They also stated that the City could opt for a 5-year renewal at $2,500 per camera, without the price lock for new cameras, through June 30, 2024. If the City does not want to enter into a 5-year agreement, the price for the cameras in 2024 will be $3,000 each or $63,000 total.\nLisa Dunn, Flock Safety Sales Manager, clarified this would lock in $2,500 cost per camera if the Board would execute now for new five (5) year term agreement and includes option to add additional cameras by year-end at the same cost per camera if executed by December 31, 2023. Or the Board can wait until the current agreement is up for renewal discussions in March; if the agreement is five (5) years the cost will stay at $2,500 per camera, but if additional cameras are added the cost of the new camera will be $3,000 per camera. However, if the agreement is less than five (5) years at renewal the cost per camera will increase to $3,000.\nAlderman Cruts inquired if a new five (5) year agreement is executed could the number of cameras be reduced and cost remain at $2,500 per camera, in consideration of agreement with Gravois Bluffs TDD that reimburses the expense of ten (10) cameras. Ms. Dunn replied no, the numbers of cameras cannot be reduced; however, an agreement could be two (2) separate agreements with concerns of Gravois, Bluffs TDD termination during the five (5) year term but noted the price of the cameras not under the 5-year agreement would increase.\nAlderman Wisbrock inquired if there was a standard out in the agreement. City Attorney Erin Seele replied the City signed their contract - however if there is a multi-year appropriation term that could be implemented into the five (5) year agreement. Ms. Flock shared a redline version would need to be submitted for their legal review.\nAlderman Maserang asked Captain Lawson if Flock cameras have assisted in investigations. Captain Lawson replied Flock have assisted in investigations, however, he cannot recommend signing a five (5) year agreement due to always evolving technology. Captain Lawson noted that he is inquiring what systems other municipalities/agencies are utilizing.\nCity Administrator Nikki Finkbiner asked the Board if they were considering adding additional cameras this year, if not the consideration of term length can be revisited at the renewal discussions in March. After discussion, there was not a desire to add additional cameras at this time.\nDiscussion ensued regarding the concern of locking the City in for five (5) years without knowing if technology would change.\nAlderman Maserang inquired if upgrades and updates were an additional cost. Ms. Dunn replied updates to the software are ongoing and part of the agreement. If the replacement of a camera is needed and covered under the terms and conditions, Flock subscription model will replace it with the same or upgraded camera. Alderman Clauss confirmed that the City does have to pay for that replacement camera and Ms. Dunn responded yes.\nMs. Dunn shared they are seeing other agencies either adding cameras and/or signing five (5) year agreements that utilize Flock camera systems, mainly due to large networking and stated she could get that list to the City.\nFollowing discussion, Alderman Clauss made a motion to forward to the October Board of Aldermen meeting the renewal for Flock Cameras. The motion was seconded by Alderman Cruts.\nAlderman Cruts rescinded his second. Alderman Clauss rescinded her first.\nAlderman Clauss suggested the topic be continued to the renewal discussions in March. There were no objections.\n\nConsideration of a request to amend Schedule IV One-Way Streets and Alleys of the Municipal Code to include Goode Drive.\nOver the past few years, the City and the St. Louis County Police Department have received numerous complaints about excessive cut-through traffic on Goode Drive. The cut through traffic is primarily an issue during the morning rush hour, from around 6:00 a.m. to around 8:00 p.m. Residents along the street have concerns regarding cars driving at a high rate of speed, considering the pavement width is only ten feet (10') wide.\nAlthough the street has a sign indicating \"local traffic only\", enforcement of \"local traffic\" is difficult. In conversation with a couple of police officers, it was suggested to limit the street to one-way traffic. The one-way traffic would be delineated for traffic flow from Water Street southwest to Church Street. With the majority of traffic in the morning traveling northeast on Goode Drive, attempting to beat traffic traveling through the Olde Towne area, the one-way roadway would give the police more ability to enforce the restricted traffic flow on Goode Drive.\nIf approved, Schedule IV One-Way Streets and Alleys of the Municipal Code would need to be amended to include Goode Drive. Also, the Public Works Department would install \"Do Not Enter\" and \"One Way\" signs at the intersection of Goode Drive and Church Street along with a sign indicating \"No Cut Through\" to Water Street at the intersection of Church Street and Main Street. \"One-Way\" signs would also be placed at the intersection of Goode Drive at Water Street.\nAlderman Cruts and Alderman Jokerst shared they would like to have the affected residents' input on the consideration before moving forward with request.\nCaptain Lawson shared this request has been brought forward as a result of complaints received from residents in that neighborhood and the local traffic only sign is broad in definition to enforce. Public Works Director Dan Howard shared he has received complaints from three (3) of the four (4) residents that they are unable to get out of their driveways due to the high volume of cut-through traffic using Goode Drive in the mornings. The road is only ten feet (10') wide which does not allow cars the ability to pass each other.\nMarlin Mackley, 509 Main Street, Fenton MO expressed he is in favor of a one-way street, morning traffic is heavy heading to Larkin Williams (the River Road), and he has had conversations with residents on that street about the traffic issues. He further shared a con would be vehicles driving the wrong way as he sometimes observes on Ferry Street.\nMayor Maurath inquired if Goode Drive is a sanctioned City street. Public Works Director Dan Howard shared it is not within the terms however it is City property.\nCaptain Lawson shared if the drive is made one-way it would give police the ability to enforce the restricted traffic flow and noted, if approved, warnings could be issued during grace period of the implementation.\nCity Administrator Nikki Finkbiner shared a possible consideration could be to amend Section 340.290; redefining vehicles prohibited from using streets designated for local traffic only.\nAlderman Jokerst suggested that Mr. Mackley speak with the residents regarding consideration of one-way street on Goode Drive so that residents can gather thoughts for discussion.\nAfter discussion, Alderman Clauss suggested to continue to the November Board of Aldermen Committee meeting to allow Staff to gather more information and communicate with Goode Drive and Dalton Hill residents. There were no objections.\n\nAlderman Bereitschaft made a motion to move Community Development and Affairs topic next on the agenda. The motion was seconded by Alderman Wisbrock. Upon a voice vote being taken, it was announced that the motion was passed unanimously by the Board of Aldermen.\n\nCOMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND AFFAIRS - Ald Bereitschaft, Chairman (Harrell, Clauss, Maserang)\nConsideration of proposals for a new monument sign in front of City Hall.\nAt the July 13th Committee Meeting, the Community Development and Affairs Committee approved Staff seeking proposals for a new, non-digital sign for City Hall via a Request for Proposals (RFP). The RFP was advertised in late July and the deadline for submittals was on August 17th.\nAlthough ten (10) companies requested a copy of the RFP, only two (2) proposals were received from Warren Sign Company and Piros Signs.\nDuring the September 7th Committee Meeting, the Board reviewed the proposals and a motion were approved to \"continue to the October Board of Aldermen Committee Meeting the proposal from Warren Sign Company for a monument sign in front of City Hall with standoff lettering, acrylic, interior back lighting and gather additional information regarding warranty\".\nAn email response from Warren Sign Company including a proposed aesthetic change and further details regarding illumination was available for review. Also, a revised proposal/cost for the sign that includes warranty information.\nSteve Behrens, Warren Sign Company, was in attendance of the meeting to answer questions. Mr. Behrens shared the cost decreased due to the lighting required with revision with standoff lettering, acrylic, interior back lighting and noted background color changed to the top to reflect lighting better option.\nThere was discussion of adding a complete street address with street name or eliminating street numbers and keeping only the logo for a cleaner look to the base.\nMayor Maurath stated his biggest concern was visibility and asked whether the sign would be visible from 141. Steve Behrens replied, yes.\nFollowing discussion, Alderman Bereitschaft made a motion to forward to the October Board of Aldermen meeting the new revised monument sign in front of City Hall with removal of street numbers. The motion was seconded by Alderman Maserang. Upon a voice vote being taken, it was announced that the motion was passed unanimously by the Committee.\n\nPERSONNEL - Ald. Huels, Chairman (Cruts, Wisbrock, Jokerst)\nDiscussion regarding Annual Performance Evaluations.\nExisting categories were reviewed for consistency and conciseness - hopefully creating a more user-friendly form. Additionally, based on comments at the August 7th Committee Meeting, the category of \"Exceeds Expectations\" has been removed for review and consideration. Proposed performance evaluations were available for review.\nAlderman Jokerst suggested removing \"as determined by the Board of Aldermen\" from the policy 2(b) for a cleaner reading. There were no objections.\nAlderman Jokerst feels all comment boxes need to be completed on evaluations. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner shared policy requires comments only if an employee is not meeting expectations.\nAlderman Cruts shared he feels supervisors need to be instructed to note when an employee has exceeded expectations for their employee file and can be noted on the evaluation.\nMayor Maurath shared he feels the numbers need to be eliminated as it has not served the process well in the past. He feels Department Heads need to note if an employee exceeds expectations, but they need to only determine if an employee is eligible or not eligible for an across-the-board increase.\nAlderman Clauss shared she feels not all areas warrant an exceeds expectations, but some do, but to warrant an exceeds expectations rating it must be done consistently. She feels it is not fair for an employee who meets expectations to receive the same increase as an employee who consistently exceeds.\nAlderman Jokerst shared she is not sure she wants to eliminate numbers for guide/range for increases. Alderman Wisbrock shared he feels Department Heads could be educated further on how to complete the form.\nFollowing discussion, Alderman Huels made a motion to forward to the October Board of Aldermen meeting the Annual Performance Evaluations as proposed. The motion was seconded by Alderman Jokerst. Upon a voice vote being taken, it was announced that the motion was passed unanimously by the Committee.\nCity Administrator Nikki Finkbiner shared to allow Staff time to complete evaluations by October 31st as required per the Personnel Manual, a decision needs to be made.\nFollowing further discussion, Alderman Huels made a motion to open the topic to the full Board.
