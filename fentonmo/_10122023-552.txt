FINANCE -Aid. Cruts, Chairman (Wisbrock, Huels, Jokerst)
•      August 31, 2023, Monthly Financial Report.
       Alderman Cruts summarized the monthly financial report. There were no questions or comments.

•      Discussion regarding Financial Services Contract.
       Following competitive bidding for the City's financial                                         services via a           Request for Proposal (RFP) in
       2013, the City approved an                      agreement with the City's current financial service provider, Sikich, LLP
       (formerly Hochchild, Bloom & Company, LLP), via Ordinance 3347. Since such time, the City has
       extended the agreement to                       continue services with Sikich, LLP.                              The most recent extension                      was in
       October of 2022, via Ordinance 4269.

       As the existing agreement is set to expire on December 31, 2023, an extension to the agreement will
       need to be approved by the Board of Aldermen to continue services in 2024 . The City's current 2023
       agreement also approved a monthly fee                                  of $7,550 (for sixteen (16) hours per week); however, the
       proposed monthly fee for 2024 is $8,000, a $450 monthly increase. It is noted that Tammy Alsop will
       be performing the services for the City on both days (sixteen (16) hours per week).

       City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner noted that this an additional                                                I-year term contract that expires on
       December 31, 2024, unless cancelled by either party and noted the City can cancel at any time.

       Alderman Cruts made a motion to forward to the October Board of Aldermen meeting the Financial
       Services Contract for an additional I-year term at the proposed monthly fee of $8,000 monthly fee. The
       motion was            seconded         by    Alderman           Wisbrock.         Upon       a   voice vote          being taken,           the    motion        passed
      unanimously by the Committee.

•     Presentation and request by Infinity Hospitality, LLC for a CID, TDD, and Tax Abatement for the
       redevelopment of a property located at 800 S. Highway Drive.
      The request was withdrawn.

Alderman Jokerst made a motion to move Health and Safety topics next on the agenda. The motion was
seconded by Alderman Clauss.                          Upon a voice vote being taken, the motion passed unanimously                                                      by the
Committee.

HEALTH AND SAFETY - Aid. Jokerst, Chairman (Cruts, Wisbrock, Clauss)
•     Consideration of bids for the 2023 Demolition Services.
      As requested by the Board, the City advertised for bids for the 2023 Demolition Services on August 18,
      2023. A mandatory pre-bid meeting was held on site at 800 S. Highway Drive (former Stratford Inn) on
      September 12, 2023, where twenty-two (22) prospective bidders were in attendance. The bid opening
      was held on September 19, 2023, at 10:00 a.m. and six (6) bids were submitted before the deadline for
      consideration. The bids for the 2023 Demolition Services for consideration were available for review.

      Spirtas Wrecking Company $326,691 was the lowest bid.


                                                                                        2
                                                                 Board of Aldermen Committee Meeting
                                                                              October 12, 2023

City Attorney Erin Seele explained the building was declared a dangerous structure after hearing in
October 2022. There have been numerous conversations with the owners to move forward with the
property and the City has tried to be cooperative, but it is a dangerous structure. There was a warrant
served to access property for pre-bid walk-through for                                  bids to demo the building before spending
taxpayer money. She believes the attorney is here as the property owners have now said they want to
demolish the building themselves.                     Does the City allow more time before demolition or move forward
with consideration.

Loren       Ettinger,      120    S.   Central       Avenue,       Clayton       MO      was     present      representing        owners       Infinity
Hospitality,        LLC.     He    shared      the owners        have     reviewed       the    City's    demolition        bids    and    they    have
secured a contract from                Spirtas Wrecking Company themselves to demolish the building. They are
currently working on whether to demolish the entire building or can it be partially demolished leaving
foundation for future building.

Alderman Cruts expressed if partial would be considered it would need to be structurally safe. City
Administrator Nikki Finkbiner expressed that permits would be needed from County and County would
determine it request would be structurally safe before issuing permit.

Alderman Wisbrock expressed concerns if partial demolition on                                        how     remaining building would                 be
secured for safety and security as the building is                            not secured right now and a safety concern. Mr.
Ettinger responded that he did                    not have       an answer to          how it would           be   secured as they have not
completed the review to determine if anything would remain.

Alderman Wisbrock continued that he understands the fire district will not service that building because
of its unsafe condition and that the police expend a lot of resources on that building as is, so he has a
big concern leaving any of it up.

Alderman Jokerst             inquired      if Infinity      Hospitality would            perform       demolition,        how     long would the
demolition take. There has been no maintenance, mowing, painting, etc. to show effort to try to take
care of the building or grounds.                   Mr. Ettinger responded that the owners had plans but then covid hit
and he is not trying to make excuses, but it was impossible to get a loan at that time.                                         Alderman Jokerst
responded that she understands that, but they have done nothing to at least make it look like a good
structure. Mr. Ettinger responded he wished it was possible to make it look like a decent structure.

City Attorney Erin Seele shared since Infinity Hospitality has taken over ownership, the building has
further deteriorated. The dangerous structure hearing was a year ago.                                      She stated the hazards are well
known including that there has been a fire.

Alderman Jokerst stated she                   is not interested         in   partial demolition.           She feels      the owners are now
moving forward with demolition consideration due to the City securing bids and moving forward with
demolition        consideration.          She expressed           frustration      with the amount of City resources expended
because the property owners have not taken care of the building.

Mr. Ettinger stated the owners are working on design for a new building.

Alderman Maserang stated he is not in favor of partial demolition and believes the demolition needs to
be complete.         That building is condemned, and the partial building will still be condemned.

Alderman Clauss inquired on timeline for demolition. Alderman Cruts expressed demolition needs to
occur quickly and not be drawn out.                     Mr. Ettinger stated Erin told him the City wants timing so it is on
the top of his list.


                                                                         3

                                                                October 12, 2023

Alderman Bereitschaft expressed he feels Infinity Hospitality request to demolish themselves is a delay
tactic    and    is not     in favor      of delay.        Mr. Ettinger stated           they have already been working on                       that
engineering so it will not cause delay.

Alderman Huels asked Community and Development Director Amy Starck what the typical timeline
was to obtain demolition permits. Community and Development Director Amy Starck replied typically
seven to ten (7- I 0) days for permits from the City but she did not know the typical timeline for County
permits.      It was expressed that the Patels could seek a permit tomorrow.

Mayor Maurath thanked Mr.                    Ettinger for attending the meeting, and shared he                           has safety concerns
regrading a partial demolition and any delay as the building is currently not safe or secure.                                               He has
personally seen people walk into that building and stated we have been lucky this far as it is a big safety
concern.

Mr. Ettinger shared he spoke to the owners fifteen ( 15) minutes prior to this meeting.

Public Works Director Dan Howard shared it can take weeks before a demolition permit is approved by
the County. He further shared the timeline from start to finish would be two - three (2-3) months and
before actual demolition would commence utilities have to be disconnected.

Mayor Maurath asked Community and Development Director Amy Starck if there have been multiple
conversations         with    the   owners       concerning what needs               to   be   done.     Community          and    Development
Director Amy Starck replied yes. Mayor Maurath stated for the record she answered yes from her seat.

Mr. Ettinger agreed on the safety concerns. The owners were asked to obtain bid from Spirtas, they
received that bid. There has been little communication between him and the owners due to his meetings,
but he stated when he gets involved things get done.                                 He stated they         can put together a timeline,
submission for permits, and deadline for completion of the job.

Alderman Wisbrock stated he is done with giving time. He is in favor of forwarding demolition services
to the October Board of Aldermen meeting for consideration. There is opportunity for discussion at that
meeting.

Alderman Maserang inquired if the Spirtas contract with Infinity Hospitality was the same price as the
quote given to the City. Mr. Ettinger replied yes.

Alderman Jokerst made a motion to forward to the October Board of Aldermen meeting the 2023
Demolition Services. The motion was seconded by Alderman Wisbrock.

Alderman Wisbrock rescinded his motion. Alderman Jokerst rescinded her motion.

Alderman Jokerst made a motion to forward to the October Board of Aldermen meeting the 2023
Demolition       Services with         Spirtas     Wrecking Company                for   $326,691.       The motion was seconded                  by
Alderman Wisbrock.

Upon the roll being called, the Committee voted as follows:

                 Alderman Clauss                     Aye                    Alderman Cruts                      Aye
                 Alderman Wisbrock                   Aye                    Alderman Jokerst                    Aye

It was announced that the motion was passed unanimously by the Committee.


                                                                       4

          Alderman Wisbrock suggested an agenda item for consideration to demolition service be placed on
          October meeting prior to consideration of the bill.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1

                  RiverChase YMCA.
                  Tom            Verheyen,                   RiverChase                     YMCA                 Director               was          in      attendance                   of the             meeting               via        Zoom
                  Videoconference.                             The          proposed                 YMCA                 2024           Capital             Projects              for       RiverChase                     YMCA                 were
                  available for review.

                  Alderman Jokerst inquired on $300,000 generator request. Alderman Wisbrock shared he does see
                  the        price          tag        as       high          but        views            the        expense               of the             generator                 would             assist          if needed                  for
                  emergency/disaster backup.

                  Mr. Verheyen shared the YMCA guarantees that for every community they are located in, they
                  provide safe shelters and cooling and warming centers. Their only requirement is that the person
                  has to pass sexual offender screening for access into the center.

                  Alderman Huels asked Mr. Verheyen how many of the other YMCA locations have a generator.
                  Mr. Verheyen replied all the rec-plex centers (Car5mdelet Park, O'Fallon, all facilities over 70,000
                  square feet) have generators.

                  Alderman Maserang shared the RiverChase YMCA is a voting site, and he feels if there would be a
                  power outage on election day it would be a benefit to be able to keep the building up and running.

                  Mr. Verheyen shared in discussions with City officials and YMCA properties team, it would be
                  beneficial and serve as a protection for the expensive pool pumps, HVAC system, and other large
                  systems.

                 Alderman Jokerst inquired on expense for outdoor play structure request. Mr. Verheyen shared the
                 current outdoor play structure is twenty (20) years old, unsafe, features on the structure are broken,
                 and the main infrastructure underneath is rusted and deteriorating. Due to the age of the structure,
                 replacement parts cannot be obtained.

                 Alderman Maserang inquired                                                 if any grants were available.                                            City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner
                 expressed staff can inquire on available grants and further noted that the City was considering
                 replacing the outdoor play structure before the YMCA took over management of the facilities.

                 City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner shared the $400,000 cost for the structure is not a quote but is
                 an estimate, and to obtain true cost the project will need to go out for bid for options. The YMCA
                 Board would review bids for best options to present to the Board of Aldermen for consideration.

                   Alderman Wisbrock asked if expense would be paid for by the restricted parks/storm water funds.
                   City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner replied yes.

                   Mayor Maurath shared discussions regarding the generator occurred earlier this year and he thought
                   it needed to be reviewed for feasibility. He feels discussions with Ameren UE would be beneficial
                   for      reasons            for       power           loss       and        power            levels.          City        Administrator Nikki                              Finkbiner               shared           the
                  generators at City Hall and Public Works building only power a partial part of the buildings when
                  they are being used.

                  Public Works Director Dan Howard shared when the RiverChase facility was                                                                                                               built there is                 an
                  agreement with Fabick when power went out during an emergency, they would provide a temporary
                  generator that would                                power           partial          part of RiverChase,                              the      wiring            is    already            in     place         for       a
                  temporary solution. Alderman Maserang suggested the agreement with Fabick needs to be reviewed
                  further to make sure service is still available.

                  Alderman Wisbrock shared there are options for type of generators new, lease, or used. He feels an
                  audit needs to be done to determine the size of generator needed for disruption of services. Mr.
                  Verheyen stated that process was completed to obtain the quote from American Electric Data, Inc.,
                  that       was         available              for      review,            $302,555                covers           disruption               of services                 for      the       entire         facility.
                  Alderman Jokerst stated she is in favor of a generator but needs to be reassured what is essential
                  and what is not.

                  Following discussion, Alderman Huels made a motion to go out for bid for outdoor play structure.
                  The motion was seconded by Alderman Jokerst. Upon a voice vote being taken, the motion passed
                  unanimously by the Board of Aldermen.

                  meeting to allow Staff additional time to obtain quotes for two to four (2-4) Pickleball Courts in
                  Fenton City Park, constructed with standard pickleball court materials and with needed fencing,
                  nets, etc. for further consideration.

•       The Parks and Recreation Committee/free Advisory Board recommended the following:
         •        Approval of Parks and Recreation Projects for the 2024 Fiscal Year Budget as presented
                  during the meeting.

                 Alderman Huels inquired if pickle ball courts could be located near Olde Town pavilion. Public
                  Works Director Dan Howard replied Olde Town is not as much of floodway concern as Fenton City
                 Park. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner stated she would need to review as land may be deed
                 restricted as property was purchased with FEMA funds.

                 Alderman Jokerst inquired on landscaping for Heroes Memorial. She feels the landscaping was just
                 redone at the Memorial by a Boy Scout project; she feels                                                                                landscaping expense would be better
                 spent in other parks.

                 Alderman Maserang shared he was                                                     not in          favor of the $200,000 expense to install pickle ball
                 courts. He shared that currently there are 4.8 million pickle ball players in the country compared to
                 24.4 million soccer players. The Board voted to not move forward with soccer field lighting with a
                 $336,000 expense for two (2) fields, which he feels would serve more people. On average it would
                 cost 4.1 cents per player for pickle ball courts vs 1.3 cents per player for soccer lighting. He feels
                 pickle ball is more a rave, while soccer continues to grow and stays consistent. Alderman Maserang
                 inquired if grants were available for the project. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner stated she feels
                discussion would be great topic contained within a Master Plan.

                                                                                                                     6

                    Alderman Jokerst stated she disagreed with City Administrator's comment regarding need                                                                                                                                     for a
                    Master Plan. She further expressed pickle ball serves a different genre of people than soccer but
                    agrees pickle ball may be a fad.

                    Alderman Huels made a motion to forward to the October Board of Aldermen meeting the Parks
                    and Recreation Projects for the 2024 Fiscal Year Budget as presented during the meeting. The
                    motion was seconded by                                         Alderman Clauss. Upon                                       a voice vote                     being taken, the motion                                    passed

      There were no questions or comments.

•     Other items from the Planning and Zoning Department:
      There were items for discussion.

MISCELLANEOUS
•    Consideration of John Fabick Service Award Nominations.
     This year, there were two (2) nominations for the John Fabick Community Service Award:

      •    Dan Hagan - who served as a trustee of San Simeon Estates Subdivision. He did a lot of work
           around the subdivision himself. He loves his neighborhood and does anything to keep it up and
           looking good while keeping HOA costs down. He goes above and beyond the call of duty as a
           trustee.

     •     Vince Lochirco - who dedicates his time creating wooden toys and puzzles in his basement that are
           donated to Mercy Hospital Children's Unit and Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital for a gift to a
           child   who    is going through a         rough time.       Vince receives no money or reimbursement for                       the
           material and supplies needed. His reward is the many smiles that his gifts bring to those children.
          Those gifts are taken home by each child, so it is a constant job keeping them in stock.

     After discussion, Alderman Cruts made a motion to nominate Vince Lochirco for the 2023 John Fabick
     Service Award. The motion was seconded by Alderman Bereitschaft. Upon a voice vote being taken, the
     motion passed unanimously by the Board of Aldermen.
