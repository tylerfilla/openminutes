DISCUSSION OF AMENDMENTS TO THE COMPREHENSIVE DEVLOPEMT PLAN

          Community        Development       Director     Amy     Starck    provided     a draft   of the     proposed     changes     to the
          Comprehensive Plan based on previous workshop discussions. It was noted that while putting together the
          draft,   Staff    found     elements     of   the    Residential     and    Commercial        Planning     Areas     that   needed
          clarification/direction from the Commission.

          Director Starck stated that the 1997 Comprehensive Plan identifies large lots within the Residential area as
          those with a minimum of one acre. As it has been a goal to retain the directives of the 1997 Plan which

               include protecting environmentally sensitive areas through large lot developments, she inquired whether
               the   Commission       also   wanted     to   include    similar   language      in the    draft. Following       discussion,     the
               Commission agreed to specify a minimum one-acre lot size to eliminate any ambiguity.

               Discussion     was    then   held   regarding     the Commercial         Planning     Area.   Director     Starck   reminded      the
               Commission that residential uses were discussed during the previous workshop. While the Commission
               made clear that there was no desire to see multi-family or stand-alone apartment developments within the
               Commercial Planning Area, the detennination was not as                       clear for mixed-use developments. Director
               Starck stated that, because the Plan serves as a tool for future planning, the Commission should clarify
               what their future vision might include. City Attorney Erin Seele added that it is best to be specific so that
               the Plan can be relied on for future decision making.

               Discussion ensued regarding the viability of mixed-use developments and what support they might have
               within the community. Additionally, the Commission talked about potential tax implications if commercial
               uses are lost to mixed-use developments. Mayor Maurath noted that more residents require more City
               services and stated that he is not in favor of such a development if it is just to fill up vacant spaces, but
               should it be addressed        in the Comprehensive Plan, he             would    highly encourage a proportional balance
               between commercial and residential uses to preserve economic stability and preserve the commercial area.
              Other Commissioners commented that retail has changed in the time since most of the commercial area
              was developed, and while it is difficult to predict the future, it is to the benefit to the City to be flexible.
              Mayor Maurath reiterated that a TIF was used to initiate infrastructure for a retail development in Gravois
               Bluffs which should be considered when contemplating mixed-use.

              The Commission continued to debate the pros and cons of a mixed-use development. Concerns were raised
              about keeping with the character of the area and the impact on surrounding properties. Director Starck
              commented that the Commission has the option to be very specific and could put parameters that limit
              developments such         as   proportionality     of uses,    appropriate     locations, and other such constraints. City
              Attorney     Seele    added    that it   is fine   to say    no   if the   Commission       doesn't    envision    these    types   of
              developments, but that the Comprehensive Plan should be clear rather than staying silent.

              Following discussion, it was put forward that Staff provide a draft with some of the parameters discussed
              before a decision could          be made on whether or not to include                limited    mixed-use     in the Commercial
              Planning     Area    of the     Comprehensive        Plan.   Chainnan       Yeoman      called   an   additional     workshop      for
              discussion.
