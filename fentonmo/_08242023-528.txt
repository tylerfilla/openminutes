CDBG FUNDS TIÂ·m .OUGH THE HOME IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM
Mayor Maurath noted          for the record that the CDBG program              is administered     by St. Louis County       and
Fenton will    be allocated around $40,000 for the 2024 year.               The money is used for home improvement
projects for those individuals that qualify and are selected by St Louis County. After a ce1tain time, iflhe
funds are not used, the funds can go for Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) projects throughout the
City.   Mayor Maurath fu,ther noted that the grant is administered through St. Louis County, so the City
does not know anybody that is involved or their finances.

City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner explained               St. Louis County's Office of Community                Development
(OCD) is making changes to how they administer the municipal allocations for the CDBG                              funds. They
will be switching from an annual           funding cycle to     a three (3) year funding cycle. The City           will receive
$60,000 during a three (3) year cycle, instead of receiving $20,000 each year (i.e.,                        FY2023 $20,000,
FY2024 $40,000, and FY2025 $0).

City Administrator Nikki         Finkbiner shared there have been           inquiries if in    the past there were unused
funds that the City was able to use toward ADA projects in the City and stated the funds have been fully
expended through the program for individual projects.
Alderman Cruts inquired on          income requirements. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner stated income is
certified by St. Louis County, primarily benefits low-moderate-income residents.
Alderman     Wisbrock      inquired   if there   would    be remaining funds       on multi-year allocation        if it would
rollover. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner replied yes.
County is asking for the City's help to advertise the program as the number of applications being received
has declined.
