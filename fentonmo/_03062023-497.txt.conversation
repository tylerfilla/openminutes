Currently, there\n    are five (5) tables at Westside Park, six (6) at each shelter at Bud Weil Park, three (3) wood and two\n    (2) metal at Valiant Park, nine (9) at Hitzert Pavilion, eight (8) at Shelter l and ten (IO) at Shelter 2.\n    Hitzert and Shelter I Pavilions will each have ten (10) tables prior to the start of the rental season. A\n    total of fifteen ( 15) tables were identified as needing to be replaced due to rust and deterioration on\n    the frame possibly caused from continued dragging over the concrete slabs.                        Additionally, the City\n    needs ten (10) more tables for the new Meramec Pavilion.\n\n                                              Parks and Recreation Committee Meeting\n                                                          March 6, 2023\n\f\n                                                                                  th\n          As discussed at the February 6                                               Parks and Recreation Committee Meeting, Staff has looked into the\n          cost to purchase new tables for the shelters including the new Meramec Inn shelter. New wooden\n          tables, similar to what the City currently has, range in price from $700-$900. Thermo plastic or vinyl\n          type metal coated tables range                                              in price for $950 - $1200. The coated metal tables can be higher\n          depending on the type of coating.\n\n         Based on the above, Staff is requesting to purchase a minimum of twenty (20) coated metal tables.\n         Ten (10) for the new Meramec Inn Pavilion and ten (10) to replace replacements the tables at the\n          Hitzert Pavilion.                        Replacement of all tables to the metal coated type would occur in subsequent years.\n         Public Works does have some recently \"rebuilt\" tables that will be used to replace the remaining five\n         (5) tables of the fifteen (15) identified to be replaced as noted above until future replacement occurs.\n\n         In order to purchase the initial twenty (20) coated metal tables, Staff is requesting a budget of $25,000\n         be added to the 2023 budget.\n\n         The reason                    for       the       request of the                       coated metal                      is     the       longevity               of the            tables with                   little       to     no\n         maintenance and will be fastened to the concrete. Currently, on a yearly basis, Staff must replace\n         rotted or damaged wood planks, paint the surface, and                                                                                  is consistently removing staples placed by\n         people renting or using the pavilions.\n\n         After discussion, Audrey Wattler made a motion to approve the purchase of the initial twenty (20)\n         coated metal tables and request a budget of $25,000 be added to the 2023                                                                                                                 budget. Lynn Hughes\n         seconded the motion.\n\n                   5 Ayes; 0 Nays, I Absent, 0 Abstain:                                                      Motion APPROVED by voice vote.\n\n\u2022        Discussion regarding a bathroom in Fabick Nature Preserve.\n                                                               th\n         During the February 6                                       Meeting, the Parks and Recreation Committee requested that Staff gather\n         additional information regarding options for a restroom at Fabick Nature Preserve, specifically a cost\n         estimate for a prefabricated structure.\n\n         As discussed in February, two (2) options are:\n         ( 1) Build a new bathroom facility similar to the existing restroom in Valiant Park. The cost estimate,\n                   including contingencies, was $190,000.\n\n         (2) Erect a prefabricated structure, similar to those located at Mini Ha Ha Park in Sunset Hills, but\n                  with sewer, water, and electricity. Staff was to obtain pricing options on these types of structures;\n                  however, Staff has not received a response from the manufacturer. It is                                                                                                         noted that per Sunset\n                  Hills, the units at Mini Ha Ha cost approximately $85,000, but the structures were purchased in\n                  2006. Staff is still working to obtain current pricing from the manufacturer and will forward the\n                  same to the Commission as soon as they are available.\n\n         In addition to the above, it was requested by some members of the Board that Staff review the cost to\n         rehab the existing bathroom structure at the Fabick Nature Preserve, as this option may be more cost\n        effective. A list of needed improvements that will most likely need to occur has been created and\n         Staff is seeking estimates from contractors (sewer/plumbing, electrical, and carpentry); however, as of\n         the date of this memo, these estimates have not been received. It is also noted by Staff, that should a\n         rehab of the facility occur in lieu of a new structure, the bathroom will also need to be improved for\n         ADA compliance.\n\n\n                                                                                                                         2\n                                                                                       Parks and Recreation Committee Meeting\n                                                                                                              March 6, 2023\n\f\n          Topic to be continued to allow Staff needed time to provide additional information regarding the\n          bathroom in Fabick Nature Preserve.\n\n\u2022        Discussion regarding the use of the former greenhouse area in the Fabick Nature Preserve.\n                                                                th\n          During the February 6                                      Meeting, the Parks and Recreation Committee requested that Staff gather\n         additional information regarding improvements/uses for the former greenhouse area in the Fabick\n         Nature Preserve (where the new or rehabbed bathroom will be located).\n\n         Staff requests that this discussion be continued                                                                      until a decision is made                                      regarding the bathroom\n          improvements.\n\n         After discussion, topic to be continued to allow Staff needed time to provide additional information\n         regarding the use of the former greenhouse area in the Fabick Nature Preserve.\n\nNEW BUSINESS:\n\u2022        Discussion regarding use of the former house foundation area in Fabick Nature Preserve.\n                                                                 th\n         During the                    February                6       Meeting,                the       Parks           and        Recreation Committee forwarded                                                      a    request            to\n         demolish the existing foundation wall and regrade the areas where the former Fabick house                                                                                                                                          was\n         located for Board approval.\n\n                                                                                                                                      th\n         During review of this request during the February 9                                                                               Board of Aldermen Committee Meeting, the\n         Board made a motion to send this request back to the Parks and Recreation Committee for further\n         consideration, as indicated in the meeting minutes excerpt below.\n\n        Excerpt from the February y1r Board ofAldermen Committee Meeting Minutes:\n         \u2022        Approval ofgrading of tl,e former house foundation area in Fabick Nature Preserve.\n         \u25a0\n                  Public Works Director Dan Howard explained in years past the Fabick house was removed and\n                  chain-link was installed for safety. Over the years the fence has degraded and foundation walls\n                  are failing.                 He is requesting approval to re-grade the area to address any safety concerns and\n                  graffiti issues.\n\n                  Alderman Jokers! expressed she was in favor putting money toward keeping and preserving the\n                  stone          walls.           She further                    inquired if this                         would be                 performed in-house                                 or contracted,                       with\n                  concerns of staff shortages and other numerous                                                                           City projects that need to be completed,                                                               if\n                 performed                    in-house.

The fill material from that area, to create additional parking and possible additional\n                 amenities, would be used in the re-grade of the house foundation to create a maintainable slope.\n                 Alderman Maserang voiced he feels ift here is a safety hazard concern, it needs to be addressed.\n\n                 Mayor Maurath expressed if walls removed, re-graded; maybe benches could be installed in the\n                flat area if not sloped in re-grade. He feels if the project is approved it should be contracted out\n                 as well as the deficiencies at the Beckman (Bud Weil Annex) property at the same time.

Mary Heinemann inquired if the 2018 plan\n      that was never enacted could be utilized and moved forward. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner\n      replied will need to clarify where the 2018 plan was left and will also need to consider if an overall\n      plan for the parks is desired or a small focused plan.

Currently, there\n  are five (5) tables at Westside Park, six (6) at each shelter at Bud Weil Park, three (3) wood and two\n  (2) metal at Valiant Park, nine (9) at Hitzert Pavilion, eight (8) at Shelter 1 and ten (10) at Shelter 2.\n  Hitzert and Shelter 1 Pavilions will each have ten (10) tables prior to the start of the rental season. A\n  total of fifteen (15) tables were identified as needing to be replaced due to rust and deterioration on\n  the frame possibly caused from continued dragging over the concrete slabs. Additionally, the City\n  needs ten (10) more tables for the new Meramec Pavilion.\n  \n  As discussed at the February 6th Parks and Recreation Committee Meeting, Staff has looked into the\n  cost to purchase new tables for the shelters including the new Meramec Inn shelter. New wooden\n  tables, similar to what the City currently has, range in price from $700-$900. Thermoplastic or vinyl\n  type metal coated tables range in price for $950 - $1200. The coated metal tables can be higher\n  depending on the type of coating.\n\n  Based on the above, Staff is requesting to purchase a minimum of twenty (20) coated metal tables.\n  Ten (10) for the new Meramec Inn Pavilion and ten (10) to replace the tables at the\n  Hitzert Pavilion. Replacement of all tables to the metal coated type would occur in subsequent years.\n  Public Works does have some recently \"rebuilt\" tables that will be used to replace the remaining five\n  (5) tables of the fifteen (15) identified to be replaced as noted above until future replacement occurs.\n\n  In order to purchase the initial twenty (20) coated metal tables, Staff is requesting a budget of $25,000\n  be added to the 2023 budget.\n\n  The reason for the request of the coated metal is the longevity of the tables with little to no\n  maintenance and will be fastened to the concrete. Currently, on a yearly basis, Staff must replace \n  rotted or damaged wood planks, paint the surface, and is consistently removing staples placed by\n  people renting or using the pavilions.\n\n  After discussion, Audrey Wattler made a motion to approve the purchase of the initial twenty (20)\n  coated metal tables and request a budget of $25,000 be added to the 2023 budget. Lynn Hughes\n  seconded the motion.\n\n5 Ayes; 0 Nays, 1 Absent, 0 Abstain: Motion APPROVED by voice vote.\n\n- Discussion regarding a bathroom in Fabick Nature Preserve.\n  During the February 6th Meeting, the Parks and Recreation Committee requested that Staff gather\n  additional information regarding options for a restroom at Fabick Nature Preserve, specifically a cost\n  estimate for a prefabricated structure.\n\n  As discussed in February, two (2) options are:\n  (1) Build a new bathroom facility similar to the existing restroom in Valiant Park. The cost estimate,\n  including contingencies, was $190,000.\n\n  (2) Erect a prefabricated structure, similar to those located at Mini Ha Ha Park in Sunset Hills, but\n  with sewer, water, and electricity. Staff was to obtain pricing options on these types of structures;\n  however, Staff has not received a response from the manufacturer. It is noted that per Sunset\n  Hills, the units at Mini Ha Ha cost approximately $85,000, but the structures were purchased in\n  2006. Staff is still working to obtain current pricing from the manufacturer and will forward the\n  same to the Commission as soon as they are available.\n\n  In addition to the above, it was requested by some members of the Board that Staff review the cost to\n  rehab the existing bathroom structure at the Fabick Nature Preserve, as this option may be more cost\n  effective. A list of needed improvements that will most likely need to occur has been created and\n  Staff is seeking estimates from contractors (sewer/plumbing, electrical, and carpentry); however, as of\n  the date of this memo, these estimates have not been received. It is also noted by Staff, that should a\n  rehab of the facility occur in lieu of a new structure, the bathroom will also need to be improved for\n  ADA compliance.\n\n  Topic to be continued to allow Staff needed time to provide additional information regarding the\n  bathroom in Fabick Nature Preserve.\n\n- Discussion regarding the use of the former greenhouse area in the Fabick Nature Preserve.\n  During the February 6th Meeting, the Parks and Recreation Committee requested that Staff gather\n  additional information regarding improvements/uses for the former greenhouse area in the Fabick\n  Nature Preserve (where the new or rehabbed bathroom will be located).\n\n  Staff requests that this discussion be continued until a decision is made regarding the bathroom\n  improvements.\n\n  After discussion, the topic to be continued to allow Staff needed time to provide additional information\n  regarding the use of the former greenhouse area in the Fabick Nature Preserve.\n\nNEW BUSINESS:\n- Discussion regarding use of the former house foundation area in Fabick Nature Preserve.\n  During the February 6th Meeting, the Parks and Recreation Committee forwarded a request to\n  demolish the existing foundation wall and regrade the areas where the former Fabick house was\n  located for Board approval.\n\n  During review of this request during the February 9th Board of Aldermen Committee Meeting, the\n  Board made a motion to send this request back to the Parks and Recreation Committee for further\n  consideration, as indicated in the meeting minutes excerpt below.\n\n  Excerpt from the February 9th Board of Aldermen Committee Meeting Minutes:\n  - Approval of grading of the former house foundation area in Fabick Nature Preserve.\n    \n  Public Works Director Dan Howard explained in years past the Fabick house was removed and\n  chain-link was installed for safety. Over the years the fence has degraded and foundation walls\n  are failing. He is requesting approval to re-grade the area to address any safety concerns and\n  graffiti issues.\n\n  Alderman Jokers expressed she was in favor of putting money toward keeping and preserving the\n  stone walls. She further inquired if this would be performed in-house or contracted, with\n  concerns of staff shortages and other numerous City projects that need to be completed, if\n  performed in-house. Public Works Director Dan Howard stated he wanted discussion for\n  consideration of the project and that some of the work would need to be contracted out if the\n  project would be approved.\n\n  Alderman Wisbrock shared that during the discussion at the Parks and Recreation Committee\n  meeting on February 6th, this project is in conjunction with the discussion of the project for the use of\n  the former greenhouse area in Fabick Nature Preserve, which would include the proposed\n  bathrooms. The fill material from that area, to create additional parking and possible additional\n  amenities, would be used in the re-grade of the house foundation to create a maintainable slope.\n  Alderman Maserang voiced he feels if there is a safety hazard concern, it needs to be addressed.\n\n  Mayor Maurath expressed if walls are removed, re-graded; maybe benches could be installed in the\n  flat area if not sloped in the re-grade. He feels if the project is approved it should be contracted out\n  as well as the deficiencies at the Beckman (Bud Weil Annex) property at the same time. Mayor\n  Maurath voiced concerns of installing a playground in Fabick Nature Preserve with deed\n  restrictions.\n\n  After discussion, Alderman Huels made a final motion to take the discussion of grading of the former\n  house foundation area in Fabick Nature Preserve back to the Parks and Recreation Committee\n  for more detailed information and plan for the whole area. The motion was seconded by\n  Alderman Wisbrock. Upon a vote being taken, the motion passed unanimously by the Board of\n  Aldermen.\n\n  Based on the above, the Board is seeking direction from the Parks and Recreation Committee for\n  ideas of the area.\n\n  Alderman Huels reminded the Committee the property is deed restricted and also the Board is seeking\n  a better clarification of the projects in the Fabick area as a whole.\n\n  Mary Heinemann shared she feels this project is a large expense, with minimal foot traffic and is a\n  legacy area and is unsure of changing the whole area.\n\n  Mike Abbott expressed he would like to see large trees that line the stone wall retained, and further\n  expressed the stone wall is deteriorating. He shared there are two (2) former foundations areas that\n  could be considered to be filled in to start the project.\n\n  Public Works Director Dan Howard shared the chain-link fence along the rock wall needs to be\n  replaced or removed and grade the area to remove drop-offs.\n\n  After discussion, Gary Johnson made a motion to continue the topic to allow Staff needed time to\n  evaluate hazards at the former house foundation are in Fabick Nature Preserve. Audrey Wattler\n  seconded the motion.\n\n5 Ayes; 0 Nays, 1 Absent, 0 Abstain: Motion APPROVED by voice vote.\n\n- Discussion regarding proposed Great River Greenway Signage along the Meramec Greenway\n  Trail.\n  Great Rivers Greenway is in the process of updating/replacing signage along the Meramec Greenway\n  and Angelica Gutierrez, Project Manager with Great River Greenway, provided a presentation\n  regarding the project.\n\n  Ms. Gutierrez stated they are proposing removing and upgrading signage along the Greenway, bridge\n  graphics, \"sticks\", coordinating with Public Works Director Dan Howard for ADA improvements to\n  provide the Greenway through Olde Towne district that does not run along the river road and St.\n  Louis County Parks for connection with George Winter Park, MoDOT to create a vertical separation\n  at the I-44 bridge and working on agreements for that work.\n\n  Gary Johnson expressed he would like the signage to be consistent with City signage and inquired if\n  there would be more signs installed than what is current. Ms. Gutierrez replied there are thirty (30)\n  Greenway signs to be removed and forty-two (42) signs to be installed.\n\n  Mike Abbott expressed he does not want the \"sticks\" to distract from City signage. Ms. Gutierrez\n  shared the \"sticks\" would not be located near City signs. Mary Heinemann, Lynn Hughes, and Mike\n  Abbott expressed they like the \"sticks\".\n\n  Mary Heinemann shared she likes the proposed graphics for the pillars. Mike Abbott suggested\n  painting graphics as high as possible on pillars for flood purposes.\n\n  Gary Johnson inquired on the responsibility of maintenance, repair, and replacement of signs. Ms.\n  Gutierrez stated it would be defined in the agreement with the City, but would be the responsibility of Great\n  River Greenway.\n\n  After discussion, Mary Heinemann made a motion to approve the proposed Great River Greenway\n  Signage along the Meramec Trail as presented, including approval of the \"sticks\" and bridge graphics\n  and any future recommended changes by the Board of Aldermen. Gary Johnson seconded the motion.\n\n5 Ayes; 0 Nays, 1 Absent, 0 Abstain: Motion APPROVED by voice vote.\n\n- Discussion regarding other grant opportunities through Missouri State Parks and Municipal\n  Park Grant Commission.\n  During Parks and Recreation Committee Meetings, it has been noted that multiple grant opportunities\n  exist for park improvements. As a follow up to the discussion regarding available grants through the\n  Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC) at last month's meeting, Staff wanted to provide\n  information regarding other grants available through other agencies, including the Missouri State\n  Parks and Municipal Parks Grant Commission.\n\n  City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner shared the City has utilized RTP and Municipal Park Grant\n  Commission grants in the past for projects. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner shared the below\n  information regarding those grants.\n\n  Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) - (Missouri State Parks) - Federal funding\n  available for LWCF grants is a maximum of $500,000 per project, with a minimum 50% match.\n  Grants are open to any local government, city and county, and public school.\n\n  Eligible projects must be open to the public at reasonable times.
