                 CASE 2023-TXT-05: A Petition by Laurie Fendler to amend Section 420.010 Land Use Matrix
                 of the Zoning Code to allow Indoor Unlimited Recreational Facility as a Use allowed by Special â€¢
                 Use Permit in the "OT-1" Olde Towne District.

                 Community           Development           Director       Amy       Starck      gave     a   summary         of    the    Staff    report      to   the
                 Commission. A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department. She
                explained that the            Petitioner is       requesting to        add    an   Indoor Unlimited            Recreational Facility to             the
                "OT-I" Olde Towne District as it is neither a Permitted Use nor a Use allowed by Special Use Permit
                 in the district. She added that while the Petitioner may have a particular property in mind, the text
                amendment would be applicable to the entire district and                                 is not site-specific.           The zoning map was
                pulled      up   for   the    Commissioners            to   see   the    OT- I     district    boundaries        and    characteristics        of the
                properties within OT- I .              Community Development Director Amy                            Starck read the         purpose statement
                for    the    OT-I       District      and    the     definition       of   Indoor       Unlimited        Recreational         Facility      for    the
                Commissioners.

                The Petitioner, Laurie Fendler approached. She explained that she would like to                                              construct a multi-
                purpose sport facility for basketball, indoor soccer, and volleyball on a vacant parcel in Olde Towne.
                The Commission expressed concern regarding the lack of parking in the area and the potential traffic a
                large gymnasium facility would bring. Ms. Fendler stated that the location she had in                                                 mind would
                allow for adequate parking. Additional discussion was held about whether other properties in Olde
                Towne would offer sufficient parking for an Indoor Unlimited Recreational Facility as this request
                would      amend the entire district and                  any    potential     future     impacts this        use   might cause          should the
                request be approved.

                Discussion was held regarding other athletic-related uses that are permitted in the district and whether
                the property the Petitioner was interested in could be developed for those uses. Director Starck stated
                that the property could be developed for any Permitted Use provided the proposed development meets
                the requirements of Site Plan Review and the City's Floodplain Code as it is located in the floodplain.

                Following         discussion        about     the    character        of the      district with         its mix      of small       business       and
                residential homes, Chairperson Yeoman made a motion to APPROVE CASE 2023-TXT-04 as
                drafted. Vice Chairperson Sherrel seconded the motion.
