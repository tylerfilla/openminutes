The parcel is addressed as 503\n                 Gravois Road and is zoned \"OT-1\" Olde Towne District.\n\n                 City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner gave a summary of the Staff report to the Commission. A copy of the\n                 Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department. She explained that the Petitioner is\n                 seeking to operate a restaurant on the lower level of the building that is currently vacant. As a part of the\n                 restaurant operation, the Petitioner is proposing outdoor dining within the patio area that has been used for\n                 the same purpose as past restaurants at this location.\n\n                 City Administrator Finkbiner noted that there                         is an existing prefabricated              building once used            by   Bales\n                 Auto Sales that is non-conforming. She added that there is nothing on file with the City indicating that this\n                 building was ever approved to be located on the lot. The current Code does not allow for more than one\n                 principal     building per lot          in this district,      so   Staff is    requesting the        building be        removed       as part of the\n                 conditions of the requested SUP.\n\n                 The Petitioner, Kang Na, approached. He explained that he intends to have the building removed and has\n                 contacted a contractor to get an estimate of price and timeline to do so but is still awaiting that information.\n\n                 Additional discussion was held regarding an appropriate timeframe for removal of the building. Following\n                 discussion,       the   conditions       of approval         were     amended        to require      the    non-conforming           building      to   be\n                 removed within five (5) months of approval of the SUP.\n\n                 Vice-Chairperson Sherrel read aloud the conditions of approval.
