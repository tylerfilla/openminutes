    working with the Petitioners to help them tie into the stormwater system on his property. He stated the
    proposed plans for the property would be an upgrade and an asset to Fenton.

    OLD BUSINESS: None


    NEW BUSINESS:

               A motion was made by Chairperson Yeoman and seconded by Vice-Chairperson Sherrel to move
               Case 2023-SUP-09 to the front of the agenda. The motion was approved by voice vote .
                                                                                   ..
               CASE 2023-SUP-09: A Petition by Shriya Management, LLC for a Special Use Permit to operate a
               Hotel at 650 South Highway Drive. The property is zoned "HP-1" Hospitality Park District.

               Community          Development           Director      Amy      Starck     gave     a summary         of the      Staff report       to   the
               Commission. A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department.
               She explained that the Petitioners are proposing to demolish the former Super 8 and build a new
               Home2 Suites, a Hilton brand, at this location. A hotel will require a Special Use Permit in this
               district.

              The     Petitioners,      Jiten    &    Shelly     Patel    along    with     Paul    Williams       of Premier        Hotel     Properties
              Management Service, approached. Mr. Williams explained that Premier Hotel Properties will be
              managing the property and will provide oversight to ensure the property is being maintained to
              brand      standards.       He    added      that    while     the    owners      are    ultimately       responsible        for   property
              maintenance, frequent quality checks are performed by Premier Hotel Properties and Hilton will
              assess fines if the property is found to be in inferior condition.

              The Petitioner, Jiten Patel stated that Hilton requires that they                                 have    specific portable electric
              cooktops available to             guests if they request one. The cooktops can only be used in a specific
              place, are not permanently installed in the room, and won't be available to                                       30% or more of the
              rooms at one time.             Director Starck noted that, because they will not be permanently installed
              kitchen facilities and cannot be provided to 30% of the rooms, the proposed use does not meet the
              definition of an Extended Stay Hotel found in the Zoning Code, and guests would not be allowed
              to stay more than 30 consecutive days. Director Starck further noted that this was advertised and
              would be approved as a Hotel for Home2 Suites and anything else would not be allowed and
              would have to come back to the Commission and Board for consideration.                                          Mr. Patel offered that
              Hilton does not allow permanent residency on site and confirmed guests would not stay for more
              than 30 consecutive days. The Commission discussed their concerns about portable electric cook
              tops. Mayor Maurath asked that Staff look into this a bit more.

                Following discussion, Chairperson Yeoman read aloud the conditions of approval. The Petitioner
                agreed to all.

                Conditions of Approval:
                     This Special Use Permit (SUP) is solely for Shriya Management, LLC, to operate a Home2

                          application will be approved.
                     2.   The     subject building          shall   only    be    utilized    for   a Hotel      (motel)      use,   as   defined      under
                          Section 400.030 of the Zoning Code. Any modifications to the buildings to allow for any
                          non-transient use is not approved by this SUP.
                     3.   The     property       shall     be   maintained         and    kept     in   compliance          with     existing     property
                          maintenance          and    building      standards       and    will    be   operated       and    maintained,        including
                          outward       appearances,         as   a   Hotel.     Outdoor       furniture      and    fire   pits/grills     shall    not   be

                          prohibited.
                     4.   Derelict vehicles and any vehicles which are not associated with the Hotel/motel use are
                          not permitted to be stored on the property.
                    5.    Approval of this           Special Use Permit renders all                 previous Special Use Permits null and
                          void.
                    6.    Compliance with all other applicable City of Fenton Codes and Ordinances.

              District.

Planning and Zoning Commission Meeting                                                                                                 Page4

                Chairperson Yeoman confirmed with the City Attorney that the SUP petition looks to see if the
                proposed use is appropriate for the location and now this Site Plan Review is to evaluate how the
                use fits the site.

                Community          Development          Director      Amy      Starck     gave     a summary          of the     Staff report       to   the
               Commission. A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department.
               She explained the Petitioners are proposing a new 4-story hotel at this location after demolition of
               both existing motel buildings and pool area. The proposed building materials and overall height of
               the building do not meet the requirements of the "HP-1" District; however, alternative building
               material and building height in excess of 50' can be approved by the Commission under Site Plan
               Review to maintain brand standards. Director Starck noted that some amendments are needed on
               the site plan to meet minimum parking space dimensions and paving material requirements. The
               proposed stormwater management plan will require review and approval by MSD. Director Starck
               explained that the proposed new development will meet all setback and buffer area requirements,
               including along lot lines where variances have been granted, and the lot will be landscaped to
               provide more green space than what is currently on the lot.

               In response        to   questions      from     the   Commission,          Petitioner Vaishali          Patel    explained       that they
               decided to go with a Hilton brand rather than a Wyndham brand (Super 8 and Baymont), because
               it is a better brand and because of market conditions.

              Chairperson Yeoman read aloud the conditions of approval. The Petitioners agreed to all.

               Conditions of Approval:
                    This    approval       is solely     for   the proposed         site   development for           a proposed         Hotel    (Home2
                    Suites) at 650 S. Highway Drive, as indicated on the plans submitted by the Petitioner dated

                              415 .190(F)(3 )( c) of the Zoning Code.
                         4.   The proposed access driveways within MoDOT ROW will need to be reviewed and
                              approved        by    MoDOT         before      construction.         Evidence        of such       approval      must      be

               CASE 2023-TXT-04: Consideration of amendments to the Zoning Code related to Tobacco
               Shops.

               Community Development Director Amy Starck explained that staff has received an increase in
               Occupancies          and    inquiries      for   establishments         selling tobacco          and    vape products.           Since these
               products can only be purchased by people 21 or older, similar to alcohol sales, Staff requested the
               Commission consider adding Tobacco Shops as a Use Allowed by Special Use Permit in those
               same districts where Liquor Stores may be located under a SUP. A definition of Tobacco Shops
              was provided in the Staff Memo.

              Following discussion, Chairperson Yeoman made a motion to APPROVE CASE 2023-TXT-
              04 as drafted. Commissioner Nelson seconded the motion.
