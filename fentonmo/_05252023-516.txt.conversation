Since the City would need Francis Energy's assistance to complete the\n                         application, it makes sense for the City to proceed with the application and identify Francis\n                         Energy as a subrecipient.                                    A subrecipient means a non-Federal entity that receives a\n                         subaward from a pass-through entity to carry out part of a Federal program. The City\n                         would be required to meet the grant requirements as would Francis Energy. City Attorney\n                         Erin See le recommended that if the Board would choose to proceed with the grant to have\n                         Francis Energy as a subrecipient.\n\n                                                                                                        6\n                                                                                  Board of Aldennen Meeting\n                                                                                              May 25 2023\n\f\n            Mayor Maurath inquired on legal considerations. City Attorney Erin Seele shared it is required\n            that there be a private entity involved with this grant and per the requirement, the private entity\n            is required to match the grants twenty percent (20%) requirement.\n\n            Matt Jones, Francis Energy was present via videoconference and had no further comments.\n\n            Mayor Maurath asked if Staff agreed with findings. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner replied\n           yes.\n\n           Mayor Maurath inquired for the record that the twenty percent (20%) match is legally required\n           to be paid by the private entity, not the City of Fenton. Mr. Jones replied yes that is correct.\n\n           After discussion, Alderman Bereitschaft made a motion to approve request by Francis Energy\n           for the City to apply for a Charging and Fueling Infrastructure (CFI) Grant for EV's at Wally's,\n           with Francis Energy as a subrecipient. The motion was seconded by Alderman Cruts. Upon a\n           vote being taken,          it was announced that the motion passed unanimously by the Board of\n           Aldermen.\n\n\u2756 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS -Aid Maserang, Chairman (Bereitschaft, Harrell, Huels)\n      \u2022    Monthly Report\n           o     The Horan Drive Project has been reviewed and final closeout has been approved by\n                 MoDOT.

The motion\n  was seconded by Aldennan Bereitschaft.\n\n  Paul Williams, Premier Hotel, 2523 S. Franklin Kirksville MO. Mr. Williams shared the Petitioner,\n  Jiten Patel, purchased the proposed property with partners in 2006. In 2013, when he purchased another\n  property in Kansas City, he left operations and building upkeep to his partners until 2017. The partners\n  did not keep up the property, did not pay the bills, and left the problems for Mr. Patel.                                          In 2019, Mr.\n  Patel bought out his partners. Mr. Patel incurred costs for plans and engineering for a proposed 4 (four)\n  story Hotel (Baymont Inn & Suites) where the existing northern-most Hotel building and pool area are\n  located, leaving the southern-most building to be operated as a separate, independent Hotel from the\n  Baymont Inn & Suites. In 2020, the COVID pandemic occurred making it difficult to secure funding\n  for hospitality. During that time, Mr. Patel invested approximately $200,000 to try to maintain the\n  property, the investment made little to no visible improvements.\n\n  Mr. Williams shared Mr. Patel believes that removing the current building and building a new property\n  is the correct use of the land and the only way to obtain an acceptable return on investment. Mr. Patel\nchanged plans from a lower mid-scale hotel brand to an upper scale hotel brand. Through the Hilton\n  brand     the   loan     requires      four    percent (4%)          of revenue         to   be   allocated       to an     escrow for        asset\nmaintenance.\n\nUpon the roll being called, the Board of Aldermen voted as follows:\n\n             Aldennan Bereitschaft                     Aye                      Alderman Clauss                    Aye\n             Alderman Cruts                            Aye                      Aldennan Huels\n                                                                                                                    Aye\n             Alderman Wisbrock                         Aye                      Alderman Maserang                   Aye\n             Alderman Harrell                          Aye                      Aldennan Jokerst                   Absent\n\nIt was announced that Bill No. 23-38 was passed by the Board of Aldermen and would become\nOrdinance No. 4327 when and if signed by the Mayor.\n\nApproval, with conditions, of CASE 2023-SPR-03: A Petition by Shriya Management, LLC for\nSite Plan Review of a proposed Hotel (Home2 Suites) at 650 South Highway Drive.

Since the City would need Francis Energy's assistance to complete the\napplication, it makes sense for the City to proceed with the application and identify Francis\nEnergy as a subrecipient. A subrecipient means a non-Federal entity that receives a\nsubaward from a pass-through entity to carry out part of a Federal program. The City\nwould be required to meet the grant requirements as would Francis Energy. City Attorney\nErin Seele recommended that if the Board would choose to proceed with the grant to have\nFrancis Energy as a subrecipient.\n\nMayor Maurath inquired about legal considerations. City Attorney Erin Seele shared it is required\nthat there be a private entity involved with this grant and per the requirement, the private entity\nis required to match the grant's twenty percent (20%) requirement.\n\nMatt Jones, Francis Energy was present via videoconference and had no further comments.\n\nMayor Maurath asked if Staff agreed with findings. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner replied\nyes.\n\nMayor Maurath inquired for the record that the twenty percent (20%) match is legally required\nto be paid by the private entity, not the City of Fenton. Mr. Jones replied yes that is correct.\n\nAfter discussion, Alderman Bereitschaft made a motion to approve the request by Francis Energy\nfor the City to apply for a Charging and Fueling Infrastructure (CFI) Grant for EV's at Wally's,\nwith Francis Energy as a subrecipient. The motion was seconded by Alderman Cruts. Upon a\nvote being taken, it was announced that the motion was passed unanimously by the Board of\nAldermen.\n\nCAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS - Ald Maserang, Chairman (Bereitschaft, Harrell, Huels)\nMonthly Report\no The Horan Drive Project has been reviewed and final closeout has been approved by\nMoDOT.

Mr. Williams shared the Petitioner, Jiten Patel, purchased the proposed property with partners in 2006. In 2013, when he purchased another property in Kansas City, he left operations and building upkeep to his partners until 2017. The partners did not keep up the property, did not pay the bills, and left the problems for Mr. Patel. In 2019, Mr. Patel bought out his partners. Mr. Patel incurred costs for plans and engineering for a proposed 4 (four) story Hotel (Baymont Inn & Suites) where the existing northern-most Hotel building and pool area are located, leaving the southern-most building to be operated as a separate, independent Hotel from the Baymont Inn & Suites. In 2020, the COVID pandemic occurred making it difficult to secure funding for hospitality. During that time, Mr. Patel invested approximately $200,000 to try to maintain the property, the investment made little to no visible improvements.\n\nMr. Williams shared Mr. Patel believes that removing the current building and building a new property is the correct use of the land and the only way to obtain an acceptable return on investment. Mr. Patel changed plans from a lower mid-scale hotel brand to an upper scale hotel brand. Through the Hilton brand, the loan requires four percent (4%) of revenue to be allocated to an escrow for asset maintenance.\n\nUpon the roll being called, the Board of Aldermen voted as follows:\n\nAlderman Bereitschaft           Aye                      \nAlderman Clauss                 Aye\nAlderman Cruts                  Aye                    \nAlderman Huels                  Aye\nAlderman Wisbrock               Aye                    \nAlderman Maserang               Aye\nAlderman Harrell                Aye                    \nAlderman Jokerst                Absent\n\nIt was announced that Bill No. 23-38 was passed by the Board of Aldermen and would become Ordinance No. 4327 when and if signed by the Mayor.\n\nApproval, with conditions, of CASE 2023-SPR-03: A Petition by Shriya Management, LLC for Site Plan Review of a proposed Hotel (Home2 Suites) at 650 South Highway Drive.
