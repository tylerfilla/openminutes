Clauss, Chairman (Cruts, Harrell, Jokerst)\n\u2756 Consideration ofa request to amend Schedule IV One-Way Streets and Alleys of the Municipal\n        Code to include Goode Drive.\n        Over the past few years, the City and the St. Louis County Police Department have received numerous\n        complaints about excessive cut through traffic on Goode Drive.                                                                                        Residents along the street                                    have\n        concerns regarding cars driving at a high rate of speed, considering the pavement width is only ten feet\n        (10') wide.\n\n        Although the street has a sign indicating \"local traffic only\", enforcement of \"local traffic\" is difficult.\n\n        During the Committee Meeting in October, it was discussed to limit the street to one-way traffic. The\n        one-way traffic would be delineated for traffic flow from Water Street southwest to Church Street. With\n        the majority of traffic in the morning traveling northeast on Goode Drive, attempting to beat traffic\n        traveling through the Olde Towne area, the one-way roadway would give the police more ability to\n        enforce the restricted traffic flow on Goode Drive.\n\n        After discussion City staff and/or the police department were asked to reach out to the affected residents\n        for their opinions. PO Dilks attempted to make contact with the residents and left notices regarding the\n                                   nd\n       November 2                      Committee Meeting in which this matter would be further discussed.\n\n       After further discussion between City staff and the police department, another option for consideration\n       could be to sign the street for \"no thru traffic\" which is also enforceable under the Traffic Code. This\n       designation could limit traffic traveling on Goode between Water Street and Church Street.\n\n       Either option (one-way or no thru traffic) will require amendments to the Traffic Code.\n\n       Aldennan Jokerst shared she is not in favor of one-way option but is open to the no thru traffic option\n       as it is enforceable for the police department. Alderman Clauss agreed and further stated that she feels\n       one-way would create additional issues for the residents living on the street.\n\n       Alderman Cruts shared that residents of Goode Drive had contacted him and requested he share their\n       suggestions as they could not make the meeting: Eugene and Kimberly Taylor in favor of no thru traffic\n       not one-way, or speed bumps and Andrew Toedebusch expressed the same suggestion.\n\n      Alderman Huels expressed she is in favor of no thru traffic option.\n\n      Aldennan Maserang inquired if there were enforcement or violation issues with no thru traffic in the\n      San Simeon Subdivision. Alderman Clauss shared the only concern she is aware of was restriction of\n      drivable streets in past floods. Captain Lawson stated he was not aware of any concerns.\n\n                                                                                                                           2\n                                                                                            Board of Aldermen Committee Meeting,\n                                                                                                             November 2, 2023\n\f\n       Ken Norton, 25 Goode Drive, Fenton MO 63026 shared he was happy to see this concern on the agenda.\n       He shared there has always been a traffic issue on Goode Drive. He has experienced rude and offensive\n      drivers cutting through. His wife is immobile and requires a wheelchair. While trying to load her into\n      their vehicle he almost got into physical altercations with people cutting through, impatient waiting and\n      sometimes drive through the Historical Society yard to go around. It is very stressful living on Goode\n      Drive with the high traffic cutting through. He is in favor of the no thru street option.\n\n      Shawn Clipper, I Dalton Hill Drive, Fenton MO 63026 shared she is in favor of the no thru street\n      option.\n\n      Bob Clipper, I Dalton Hill Drive, Fenton MO 63026 shared he is in favor of the no thru street option\n      not one-way. He further suggested a bill and signage be put forward to become enforceable.\n\n      Andrew Toedebusch, 11 Goode Drive, Fenton MO 63026 shared he was in favor of the no thru street\n      option     not one-way or speed               bumps. There has always                 been an       issue of traffic cutting through,\n      especially in the morning.             He further shared that he had spoken to Alderman Cruts with his suggestion\n      as he thought he was not going to be able to attend the meeting. He feels police presence and issuing\n      tickets will help reduce the issue.\n\n      Alderman Harrell inquired on Google maps routing suggestions.\n\n      St. Louis County Police NPO Aaron Dilks shared he had contacted Google maps and reported the\n      quickest route suggestion was in violation of traffic code, and they have removed Goode Drive from\n      their quickest route suggestion. Also, a stealth radar study was conducted. The study revealed a 27-\n      m.p.h. max speed and reflected traffic on Saturday twenty-five (25) vehicles, Sunday twenty-three (23)\n      vehicles, Monday fifty-four (54) vehicles, Tuesday seventy-five (75) vehicles, Wednesday sixty (60)\n      vehicles, Thursday forty-four ( 44) vehicles and Friday twenty-five (25) vehicles. This area has only\n      eleven ( 11) homes.\n\n      Mayor Maurath asked for the record if two (2) vehicles could pass each other on the street. Officer\n      Dilks replied, no.\n\n     Alderman Maserang inquired on consideration ofcul-de-sac. Alderman Wisbrock inquired ifthere were\n     snow plowing or fire district concerns if cul-de-sac. Public Works Director Dan Howard shared the\n      land is deed restricted so cul-de-sac is not allowed.\n\n     Captain       Lawson       expressed       he   feels    no    thru   traffic    and    ordinance adoption             is most      viable    and\n     enforceable option.\n\n     Following discussion, Alderman Clauss made a motion to forward to the November Board ofAldermen\n     meeting the request to amend the Traffic Code to make Goode Drive a no thru street and install signs\n     as to such. The motion was seconded by Alderman Cruts. Upon a voice vote being taken,                                                      it was\n     announced that the motion was passed unanimously by the Committee.\n\n\u2756 Consideration of the annual cost adjustment for the Police Protection Services agreement with\n     St. Louis County.\n     Per the agreement adopted under Ord. 4171 for the St. Louis County Police Department to provide the\n     City's police protection services, the annual cost adjustment for the next renewal term, January I, 2024\n     - December 31, 2024 was available for review.\n\n\n                                                                                  3\n                                                              Board of Aldermen Committee Meeting,\n                                                                         November 2, 2023\n\f\nAs     noted, the adjustment for 2024                   is a    1.2%    increase of $37,635.19,              for a     new annual cost of\n$3,029,961.72 (the 2023 annual cost is currently $2,992,326.53). This increase will be included in the\nCity's 2024 Budget.\n\nLieutenant Edgecomb, contract unit commander for St. Louis County Police Contract Services was in\nattendance to address questions.\n\nMayor Maurath inquired for the record what the amendment of $100,000 for Supplemental Supervisory\nCosts covered. Lieutenant Edgecomb explained the amendment corrected the average cost for Captain\nsalary/fringe benefits, should have been $163,000 not $63,000.\n\nAlderman Clauss asked Lieutenant Edgecomb to explain adjunct services provided to the City over and\nabove the services provided by the precinct. Lieutenant Edgecomb shared Supplemental Services include\nSWAT, K-9, helicopter, missing persons, crimes against persons, and homicide units.\n\nAlderman Maserang inquired if those services were available to all municipalities, even without an\nagreement/contract and if so, were those municipalities billed for the services. Lieutenant Edgecomb\nreplied the services are limited availability to those municipalities and is not aware of billing.\n\nAlderman Wisbrock shared this is Fenton's largest expense and inquired what effects the increase of the\ncontract. Lieutenant Edgecomb shared the average cost per officer, support and indirect costs-based on 3-\nyear moving average of population based and direct calls for service from public.\n\nAlderman Huels inquired how average cost of support service was calculated. Lieutenant Edgecomb\nexplained prior support services were charged per hour when utilized, now cost is included in the contract\nand there is a five percent (5%) increase cap.\n\nAlderman Maserang shared he researched monthly reports for self-initiated calls for service pre-pandemic\n2019 to current. The research shows a decrease:\n      2019 - average self-initiated calls were 1,500 with 150 tickets issued;\n      2020-average self-initiated calls maintained with 39 tickets issued (understandable during pandemic);\n      2021 - average self-initiated calls were 1,442 with 60 tickets issued;\n      2022 - average self-initiated calls were 1,600 with 53 tickets issued; and\n      2023 - average self-initiated calls 855.\n\nHe inquired if the reason for the decline of self-initiated calls was due to implementing 12-hour shifts in\nDecember 2022. Lieutenant Edgecomb stated he would need to review numbers.                                            Alderman Maserang\nfurther shared that recently Tactical Support refused to provide services to sweep building that was\nrequested by the City. Lieutenant Edgecomb stated he would need to review.\n\nAlderman Wisbrock inquired if twenty-two (22) officers were always staffed per the contract. Lieutenant\nEdgecomb replied yes. Alderman Wisbrock inquired if Fenton is still being provided the same service with\n12-hour shifts vs 10-hour shifts. Captain Lawson replied yes, it is the same number of beats per shift and\nexplained the coverage of the beats.\n\nCaptain Lawson shared Detective Roach transferred to Crimes Against Persons, his replacement will be\nincoming from the Affton/Southwest precinct and two (2) officers will be transferring to other divisions -\none ( l) to North County and one (I) to Metro Detail, replacements will be incoming for those positions.\n\nFollowing discussion, Alderman Clauss made a motion to forward to the November Board of Aldermen\nmeeting the annual cost adjustment for the Police Protection Services agreement with St. Louis County.\n\n                                                                             4\n                                                         Board of Aldermen Committee Meeting,\n                                                                    November 2, 2023\n\f\n      The motion was seconded by Alderman Jokerst. Upon a voice vote being taken, it was announced that\n      the motion was passed unanimously by the Committee.\n\nPERSONNEL -Aid Huels, Chairman (Cruts, Wisbrock, Jokers!}\n\u2756 Discussion regarding pay increases and salary ranges for the Public Works Department.\n      A proposal from staff to do a slight restructuring of the number of maintenance workers considered to\n      be fully staffed in Public Works by reducing workforce from fifteen to twelve (15 to 12) was available\n      for review.\n\n      Also included within the proposal was to increase the starting salary to $20.00 per hour from current\n      $15.08 per hour, with an equitable adjustment for current employees of $2.00 per hour.\n\n      Alderman Huels shared she stated previously in April that this would be reviewed at budget time.\n\n      Alderman Jokerst voiced after the discussions at the June 2023 Personnel Committee Meeting, she feels\n      wage adjustments need to be made to Public Works positions and supports the proposal.\n\n      Alderman Clauss agreed with Aldennan Jokerst and feels the Public Works Department has been\n      understaffed for too long. She feels the proposal is an equitable situation.\n\n      Alderman           Maserang          clarified       the     proposal        would        decrease        salary       approximately             $38,000        from\n      $604,000 to $566,000. Alderman Huels replied yes.\n\n     Alderman Jokerst voiced the cost of living has increased.\n\n     Alderman Wisbrock shared the City's most valuable asset comes to                                                       work every day,               it is   not the\n     equipment or property.\n\n     Alderman           Cruts expressed              he    agrees       with      increase and           inquired        if reducing the workforce was\n     sustainable. Public Works Director Dan Howard replied yes, if needed it can be reviewed in future.\n\n     Mayor Maurath stated he feels he nor the Board have had the opportunity to fully review the proposal\n     and suggested continuing to allow time for further review. He agrees with the concept but is unsure on\n     numbers.\n\n     Aldennan Huels shared she would like to see this in                                            the 2024 budget.

Alderman            Huels      asked       Financial\n     Consultant Tammy Alsop if this adjustment proposal was in the tentative budget being reviewed.\n     Financial Consultant Tammy Alsop no, unless motioned to do so.\n\n     Alderman Jokerst shared she feels the numbers have been reviewed and discussed and is not in favor\n     of continuing             discussions          further.       Mayor        Maurath         shared       a   reminder          that    the     adjustment          is   a\n     compounding cost and needs to be considered for the future.\n\n     Following discussion, Alderman Huels made a motion for the pay increases for the Public Works\n     Department be reflected in the 2024 budget as proposed.

Public Works Director Dan Howard\n          replied no, not in 2023, and noted that the City only pays if services are performed. Alderman Wisbrock\n          suggested striping stop bars in subdivisions in 2024. Alderman Maserang suggested striping Gilsinn\n          Lane.\n\n         Following discussion, Alderman Maserang made a motion to forward to the November Board of\n         Aldermen meeting the request to extend the contract with R.V.

Submission of the grant\n      needs to be completed by January 2024 and if granted, the City Hall conversion could not be started\n      until fiscal year 2025. The documents in Community Development do not meet qualifications for a\n      grant.\n\n      Alderman Maserang clarified that this conversion cost would be for the backlog of documents not future\n      documents and if this request included Public Works documents. City Clerk Jane Hungler replied\n      conversion is for already existing documents in City Hall and Community Development, it does not\n      include Public Works.\n\n      Alderman Jokerst inquired on references. City Clerk Jane Hungler shared several other surrounding\n      municipalities        utilize    Laserfiche       and    are   happy      with    the   service     and    use    of the     program.      City\n      Administrator Nikki Finkbiner further shared that SumnerOne is the City's current vendor for copier\n      service and the City has a good working relationship with them.\n\n      If approved the software cost would be budgeted for the first year and conversion would be completed\n      in sections over time as appropriate and approved. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner suggested the\n      oldest records would be converted first.\n\n      Following discussion, Alderman Harrell made a motion to forward to the November Board of Aldermen\n      meeting the Document Management Software and Document Conversion Services through SumnerOne\n      with Laserfiche and HITS and authorize applying for the Missouri Local Records Grant. The motion\n      was seconded by Alderman Huels.

Clauss, Chairman (Cruts, Harrell, Jokerst)\n\u2756 Consideration of a request to amend Schedule IV One-Way Streets and Alleys of the Municipal Code to include Goode Drive. Over the past few years, the City and the St. Louis County Police Department have received numerous complaints about excessive cut-through traffic on Goode Drive. Residents along the street have concerns regarding cars driving at a high rate of speed, considering the pavement width is only ten feet (10') wide.\n\nAlthough the street has a sign indicating \"local traffic only\", enforcement of \"local traffic\" is difficult.\n\nDuring the Committee Meeting in October, it was discussed to limit the street to one-way traffic. The one-way traffic would be delineated for traffic flow from Water Street southwest to Church Street. With the majority of traffic in the morning traveling northeast on Goode Drive, attempting to beat traffic traveling through the Old Towne area, the one-way roadway would give the police more ability to enforce the restricted traffic flow on Goode Drive.\n\nAfter discussion City staff and/or the police department were asked to reach out to the affected residents for their opinions. PO Dilks attempted to make contact with the residents and left notices regarding the November 2nd Committee Meeting in which this matter would be further discussed.\n\nAfter further discussion between City staff and the police department, another option for consideration could be to sign the street for \"no thru traffic\" which is also enforceable under the Traffic Code. This designation could limit traffic traveling on Goode between Water Street and Church Street.\n\nEither option (one-way or no thru traffic) will require amendments to the Traffic Code.\n\nAlderman Jokerst shared she is not in favor of one-way option but is open to the no thru traffic option as it is enforceable for the police department. Alderman Clauss agreed and further stated that she feels one-way would create additional issues for the residents living on the street.\n\nAlderman Cruts shared that residents of Goode Drive had contacted him and requested he share their suggestions as they could not make the meeting: Eugene and Kimberly Taylor in favor of no thru traffic not one-way, or speed bumps and Andrew Toedebusch expressed the same suggestion.\n\nAlderman Huels expressed she is in favor of no thru traffic option.\n\nAlderman Maserang inquired if there were enforcement or violation issues with no thru traffic in the San Simeon Subdivision. Alderman Clauss shared the only concern she is aware of was restriction of drivable streets in past floods. Captain Lawson stated he was not aware of any concerns.\n\nKen Norton, 25 Goode Drive, Fenton MO 63026 shared he was happy to see this concern on the agenda. He shared there has always been a traffic issue on Goode Drive. He has experienced rude and offensive drivers cutting through. His wife is immobile and requires a wheelchair. While trying to load her into their vehicle he almost got into physical altercations with people cutting through, impatient waiting and sometimes drive through the Historical Society yard to go around. It is very stressful living on Goode Drive with high traffic cutting through. He is in favor of the no thru street option.\n\nShawn Clipper, 1 Dalton Hill Drive, Fenton MO 63026 shared she is in favor of the no thru street option.\n\nBob Clipper, 1 Dalton Hill Drive, Fenton MO 63026 shared he is in favor of the no thru street option not one-way. He further suggested a bill and signage be put forward to become enforceable.\n\nAndrew Toedebusch, 11 Goode Drive, Fenton MO 63026 shared he was in favor of the no thru street option not one-way or speed bumps. There has always been an issue of traffic cutting through, especially in the morning. He further shared that he had spoken to Alderman Cruts with his suggestion as he thought he was not going to be able to attend the meeting. He feels police presence and issuing tickets will help reduce the issue.\n\nAlderman Harrell inquired on Google maps routing suggestions.\n\nSt. Louis County Police NPO Aaron Dilks shared he had contacted Google maps and reported the quickest route suggestion was in violation of traffic code, and they have removed Goode Drive from their quickest route suggestion. Also, a stealth radar study was conducted. The study revealed a 27-m.p.h. max speed and reflected traffic on Saturday twenty-five (25) vehicles, Sunday twenty-three (23) vehicles, Monday fifty-four (54) vehicles, Tuesday seventy-five (75) vehicles, Wednesday sixty (60) vehicles, Thursday forty-four (44) vehicles, and Friday twenty-five (25) vehicles. This area has only eleven (11) homes.\n\nMayor Maurath asked for the record if two (2) vehicles could pass each other on the street. Officer Dilks replied, no.\n\nAlderman Maserang inquired about the consideration of a cul-de-sac. Alderman Wisbrock inquired if there were snow plowing or fire district concerns if a cul-de-sac. Public Works Director Dan Howard shared the land is deed restricted so a cul-de-sac is not allowed.\n\nCaptain Lawson expressed he feels no thru traffic and ordinance adoption is the most viable and enforceable option.\n\nFollowing discussion, Alderman Clauss made a motion to forward to the November Board of Aldermen meeting the request to amend the Traffic Code to make Goode Drive a no thru street and install signs as to such. The motion was seconded by Alderman Cruts. Upon a voice vote being taken, it was announced that the motion was passed unanimously by the Committee.\n\n\u2756 Consideration of the annual cost adjustment for the Police Protection Services agreement with St. Louis County. Per the agreement adopted under Ord. 4171 for the St. Louis County Police Department to provide the City's police protection services, the annual cost adjustment for the next renewal term, January 1, 2024 - December 31, 2024 was available for review.\n\nAs noted, the adjustment for 2024 is a 1.2% increase of $37,635.19, for a new annual cost of $3,029,961.72 (the 2023 annual cost is currently $2,992,326.53). This increase will be included in the City's 2024 Budget.\n\nLieutenant Edgecomb, contract unit commander for St. Louis County Police Contract Services was in attendance to address questions.\n\nMayor Maurath inquired for the record what the amendment of $100,000 for Supplemental Supervisory Costs covered.

Lieutenant Edgecomb explained prior support services were charged per hour when utilized, now cost is included in the contract and there is a five percent (5%) increase cap.\n\nAlderman Maserang shared he researched monthly reports for self-initiated calls for service pre-pandemic 2019 to current. The research shows a decrease:\n2019 - average self-initiated calls were 1,500 with 150 tickets issued;\n2020-average self-initiated calls maintained with 39 tickets issued (understandable during the pandemic);\n2021 - average self-initiated calls were 1,442 with 60 tickets issued;\n2022 - average self-initiated calls were 1,600 with 53 tickets issued; and\n2023 - average self-initiated calls 855.\n\nHe inquired if the reason for the decline of self-initiated calls was due to implementing 12-hour shifts in December 2022.
