Adopted by the Planning and Zoning Commission on
     December 5, 2023, by Resolution R-23-01

                    CITY<>~ PAllK.S

                                                           INTRODUCTION

Overview
The City of Fenton, located in southwest St. Louis County, encompasses 6.38 square miles and is
bounded on the north and east by the Meramec River, on the west by Bowles Avenue, Highway
141, and Highway 30, and on the south by Jefferson County. Interstates 44 and 270 and Missouri
State     Highways            30    and      141     provide        Fenton       with      excellent        access       to    and     from      the     entire
metropolitan area.

Throughout its history, the City of Fenton has maintained a small-town atmosphere through the
balance of new growth and the preservation of its rich heritage.                                                  With a history as a farming
community, the City endeavors to maintain the balance of a farm-feel character by promoting
large      residential         lots     while        also     providing          convenient,           vibrant        commercial            areas.       Good
transportation, geographic location within St. Louis County, and a broad range of City services
continue to attract and retain industrial, commercial, and residential sectors.

The City of Fenton is a desirable location to work, play, and live due to a multitude of factors
including:

      •     Service from a fully staffed St. Louis County Police Precinct dedicated to the City of
            Fenton, which is an Internationally Accredited Police Depa11ment.
      •     A zero percent (0%) municipal tax rate on personal and real property.
      •     Highly rated Rockwood and Lindbergh School Districts.
      •     Location in the Fenton Fire Protection District, which has an exceptional Class                                                             I ISO
            rating.
      •     Proximity to interstates and highways, including Interstates 44 and 270 and Highways 30
            and 141, placing Fenton within 20 minutes from all St. Louis Metropolitan locations.
      •     Proximity to hospitals and medical care facilities.
      •     Proximity to local and regional shopping and business districts.
      •     An extensive parks and recreation system.
      •     Service by a financially stable City government that provides multiple City services, such
            as free residential trash/recycling services and yard waste/debris removal, snow removal,
            and street and park maintenance.

Purpose
With most of the City being fully developed or located in envirornnentally sensitive areas, this
Comprehensive               Development             Plan      (herein       "Plan")       is   intended        to   recommend             guidelines         for
future development or redevelopment based on current conditions along with the future needs,
visions,       and     desires      of the       community.            Within       this    Plan,      as   much       attention        is   given to        the
protection          of    existing         land      uses      as    to     the     needs       of     possible        future       developments              or
redevelopments. This Plan is not in itself a code document but a planning tool designed to be
used     as    a   directive        for    City      Officials       and      Staff in       making         decisions         related      to    the    future

                                                                                3

              and recreation spaces.
         f. Create Planning Areas that will be supported by the existing infrastructure or have the
              capacity to support the expansion of infrastructure needed for new development or
              redevelopment.
         g. Create a Future Land Use Map that reflects the goals and objectives of each planning
              area.
         h.   Encourage the rezoning of properties as needed to meet the goals and objectives of
             each planning area.
Planning Areas are as follows:
I. Public and Governmental Planning Area
II. Parks and Recreation Planning Area
III. Residential Planning Area
IV. Olde Towne Planning Area
V. Commercial Planning Area
VI. Business and Industrial Planning Area

                                     PARKS AND RECREATION PLANNING AREA

Overview
The City of Fenton, also known as the "City of Parks", has                                                                                                                          an extensive parks and recreation
system, with the Parks and Recreation Planning Area encompassing approximately one-third
(1/3) of the City's land area.

The            City            owns               eight              (8)         developed                        parks               contammg                          approximately                                350           acres              as        well           as
approximately 65 acres of open space/passive parks area. City-owned parks include Fenton City
Park, Fabick Nature                                             Preserve,                    Bud Weil                         Memorial Park,                                    Fenton Meramec                                        Greenway, Olde
Towne                   Plaza,               Riverside                       Park,              Valiant                  Park,               and           Westside                      Park.               An           extensive                      pedestrian
path/trail system, including a portion of the "Meramec Greenway Trail", provides connectivity to
parks              within                the         City           and           surrounding                           communities.                              Additionally,                            the          City            owns              a 29-acre
outdoor recreation complex, known as Fenton Sports Complex.

In 2018,                     the          City            purchased                       twelve                 (12)           acres              of undeveloped                                   land            adjacent                   to        Bud            Weil
Memorial Park and Fabick Nature Preserve known as the Bud Weil Park Annex with the intent
to develop the property as a City park and more importantly, provide public access (by vehicle)
to the Fabick Nature Preserve from the west side of the City.

Also located in the Parks and Recreation Planning Area is George Winter Park, a 117-acre public
park owned by St.                                        Louis County as well as a privately owned golf course known as Riverside
Golf Course

As          much                of the                 City's              park             and           recreation                       system                  is       located                 within                the          Meramec                        River
floodplain,                      the         City's park areas                                    have            been expanded through the                                                         buyout                of private                     properties
located in the floodplain. The purchase of these flood-prone properties, through both grants and
City funding,                             has          helped                mitigate future                                flood             damage                   and           allowed for                          the         extension of the
"Meramec Greenway" pedestrian trail network along the Meramec River while also providing
additional                       usable                park             and            recreation                       spaces                 for         the          citizens                  of Fenton                          and            surrounding
communities.

COMPREHENSIVE DEVELOPMENT PLAN


                            RESIDENTIAL PLANNING AREA

Overview
A majority     of City's    residential    dwellings    are   located   south   of Horan      Drive   and   north   of
Highway      30   with    clusters    of residential     development        located    north    of the    St.   Louis
County/Jefferson County line that were annexed into the City in 1999, most of which still retain
St. Louis County Zoning.

Throughout the years, many factors have made the City of Fenton a sought-after place to reside.
Factors include a safe and stable community and neighborhoods, numerous parks, a network of
pedestrian trails and paths, highly rated school systems, excellent Police, Fire, and City services,
and a convenient location to local and regional shopping areas as well as State Highways and
Interstates.

Much of the land in the Residential Planning Area is located in environmentally sensitive areas,
generally    characterized     by    steep   slopes,    critical drainage      courses    and    watershed      areas,
floodplains, shallow soils, thick woods, and wildlife habitats.

Past impacts of higher density residential development within environmentally sensitive areas
have   resulted    in the   City's   desire   to protect     these   areas   since   the adoption      of the    1997
Comprehensive Development Plan.

Environmentally sensitive areas contribute to the quality of life in the community by providing
essential water absorption, soil retention, slope stability, reduced run-off rates, and open spaces.
The City still strives to protect these areas from higher density development as it may further
result in higher stormwater nm-off, flash flooding, soil erosion and slump, among other property
dan1aging issues.

Since the adoption of the 1997 Comprehensive Plan, it has been a goal of the City to maintain
large-lot, single-family residential developments on the remaining undeveloped tracts located in
the Residential Planning Area. Additionally, Planned Unit Developments (PUD) are encouraged
within these areas      as the concept affords a flexible residential pattern of development with
sensitivity to the landscape.

To maintain the small-town feel and farm-like character in certain areas, to protect residential
areas from     encroachment by surrounding industrial, business,                 and   conunercial uses,      and   to
further ensure the health, safety, and welfare of the residents, it has been a long-standing policy
of the City to     separate non-residential uses         north of Horan Drive and           Wolfner Drive from
residential uses located to the south by creating "buffer areas" through zoning designations.

Goals and Objectives
The       goals         of the         Residential              Planning            Area         are     to     protect         ex1st111g          and      future         residential
development from more intensive uses, protect environmentally sensitive areas, maintain safe
and stable neighborhoods, and preserve and enhance the quality of life of the residents, all while
retaining           the     directives            of the         1997        Comprehensive                     Plan.       Said       goals        can      be      completed             by
focusing on the following set of objectives:

                      •      Protect existing residential uses within the area and control new developments
                             and/or redevelopment to residential uses through Zoning Code regulations.
                      •       In environmentally sensitive areas, continue to encourage large lot, single-family
                             developments with a minimum one-acre lot size; or encourage the use of Planned
                             Unit Developments (PUD) while retaining existing zoning, which allows smaller
                              lots with more common areas, but does not allow more housing units than would
                             be permitted in the underlying zoning district.
                      •      Prevent           industrial/business/commercial                                 encroachment                   beyond           their      established
                             boundaries into the Residential Planning Area and retain a buffer area between
                             residential uses and more intensive uses, such as industrial, through zoning.
                      •      Connect neighborhoods to City parks through a network of pedestrian sidewalks,
                             paths, and trails.
                      •      Preserve native woodlands, discourage the clear-cutting of forests, and promote
                             the installation of trees and landscaping within residential areas.
                      •      Reduce             soil      erosion           and        off-site          sedimentation                  through            best       management
                             practices.
                      •      Maintain and enhance the quality of existing residential strnctures through the
                             enforcement of the Property Maintenance Code and/or Nuisance Code to improve
                             the appearance and quality of housing.
                      •      Continue             participation              in     the     National           Flood         Insurance Program                        "NFIP" and
                             adhere to the City's Floodplain Regulations to mitigate flood damage.
                      •      When feasible,                   acquire         flood-prone              properties for                incorporation into                    the     City's
                             park and recreation system.
                      •      Consider              rezoning             all     parcels           currently            used         for       residential             dwelling             or
                             agricultural purposes                        with       St.     Louis County zoning classification (Non-Urban
                             "NU", Residential "R-1" and "R-2", and Residence Multi-Family "R-6A") to a
                             new or compatible City Residential Zoning District, with the intent to preserve the
                             existing uses.

                                                OLDE TOWNE PLANNING AREA

Overview
The Olde Towne Planning Area, encompassing the original 8 blocks of Fenton first platted
along the Meramec River in 1837, is deemed to be the historical hub of the community.                                                                                                        This
original 8-block area has now grown into a vibrant suburb of southwest St. Louis County,
known as the City of Fenton.                                     The rich heritage of the Olde Towne Planning Area yearns for
recognition                of its         past       through            appreciation,                understanding,                    and       sensitivity             to     its     unique
character and environmental concerns, specifically riverine flooding from the Meramec River
and Fenton Creek. By taking advantage of its access to excellent road and highway networks,
including Gravois Road,                                S.    Old Highway 141, State Highway                                              141, and State Highway 30,
proximity to suitable infrastmctme and improvements, and natural and scenic attributes, the
City hopes to rebuild a historic image within this area. Past renovation projects like street
improvements and historic-deco streetlamps have gradually proven the City's conunitment and
support for the                    historic area.                 With the              lack of available parking that lends itself to more
pedestrian-oriented activities and small-scale businesses, and to meet the community's desire
to attract a unique shopping experience and more out-of-town visitors, the area should only be
restored or redeveloped in a manner befitting its place in the history of Fenton.

                                                       4
Goals and Objectives
The goals of the Olde Towne Planning Area are to encourage a mix of small-scale commercial
and residential development while protecting the rich heritage and history of Fenton as well as a
sense of pedestrian-oriented character. Said goals can be completed by focusing on the following
set of objectives:

        •       Continue to make select public improvements, such as streetscapes, road infrastructure,
               parks, and traffic circulation to encourage and complement private investment in the area.
        •       Continue to develop new and enhance existing networks of pedestrian trails to encourage
               pedestrian traffic within the Planning Area.
        •      Continue to facilitate accessible sidewalks to promote pedestrian traffic, including the
               expansion and improvements to                                           the Meramec Greenway Trail system in                                                     coordination
               with Great Rivers Greenway.
        •      Encourage a complementary mix and diversity of uses to create a unique environment of
               small shops, restaurants, and residential dwellings through Zoning Code regulations.
        •      Revise the adopted Olde Towne Redevelopment Plan or develop a new plan for the Olde
               Towne area.
        •      Continue participation in the National Flood Insurance Program "NFIP" and adhere to the
               City's Floodplain Regulations to mitigate flood damage.

                                COMMERCIAL PLANNING AREA
Overview
Due to the convenient access to State Highway 141                             and/or State Highway 30, the Commercial
Planning Area has been developed as a regional commercial hub for southwestern St. Louis
County and northern Jefferson County.                        To    serve both regional and               local market         areas,    this
Planning Area provides a variety of commercial uses including a range of large-scale retailers,
smaller      complimentary            commercial/retail           establishments,           restaurants,       convenience          stores,
service-oriented          shops,      and     medical       and     urgent      care     facilities.     Major      shopping        center
developments located within the area include Gravois Bluffs, Dierbergs Fenton Crossing, Fenton
Commons, and Fenton Plaza.

                                      5
Goals and Objectives
The goals of the Commercial Planning Area are to continue to provide a regional commercial
hub through the development and redevelopment of a variety of commercial uses that serve the
local and regional market area. Said goals can be completed by focusing on the following set of
objectives:

     •    For economic stability of the community, protect existing commercial uses, control new
          developments           and/or      redevelopment           for   commercial          uses,     and    prohibit      residential
          developments/uses through Zoning Code regulations.
     •    Maintain a mix of commercial uses that complement each other through Zoning Code
          regulations.
     •    Continue to maintain public improvements, such as road infrastructure, streetlights, and
          traffic signals.
     •    Work closely           with     other    entities,    such     as   the    Chamber of Commerce,                   to   assist    in
          maintaining, expanding, and attracting businesses in the area.
     •    Coordinate with state, federal, local, and other agencies and organizations to facilitate the
          safe, efficient movement of goods and services along all transportation corridors within
          the Planning Area.
     •    Consider rezoning properties in the Commercial Planning District zoned residential (St.
          Louis County or City of Fenton Residential Districts) to a Commercial District.
     •    Consider rezoning properties zoned "OT-2" and "OT-3" Olde Towne Districts located in
          the Commercial Planning Area to a Commercial District or amend the title of the "OT-2"
          and     "OT-3" Zoning            Districts     to   reflect "Commercial" in                lieu   of "Olde        Towne",       as
          purpose, uses, and characteristics of these districts are more compatible with the City's
          Commercial Districts than the Olde Towne Districts.

In addition to business and industrial uses, the City also promotes hospitality and convenience
uses adjacent to Interstate 44 through zoning designation within this Planning Area.                                                                          Hospitality
and convenience uses include retail, hotels, convenience stores, and entertainment venues.

The Business and                    Industrial Planning area                         is   mostly         developed;            however,           demand for land
remains           high.        In-fill        development                 and       redevelopment                   that      allows          for       higher-density
arrangements is key to accommodating new businesses. Therefore, the City seeks to carefully
balance the need to meet potential growth and changing industry needs with the protection of the
adjacent Residential Planning Area and the preservation of property adjacent to Interstate 44 for
hospitality and convenience uses.

                                                6
Goals and Objectives
The goals of the Business Park and Industrial Planning Area are to encourage and maintain a
healthy, economically viable industrial and business hub in the St. Louis metropolitan area, all
while protecting nearby residential development and preserving land adjacent to Interstate 44 for
hospitality and convenience uses.                               Said goals can be completed by focusing on the following set
of objectives:                                                      ,
          •         Restrict larger, more intensive uses, such as industrial or manufacturing uses, to the
                    north side of Interstate 44 and to reduce impact on the residential areas located on the
                    south side of 44 through zoning regulations.
          •         Encourage             less      intensive          business           and      industrial          uses       in    areas       adjacent          to    the
                    Residential Planning Area through zoning to create a buffer area and reduce traffic,
                    noise, and other impacts.
          •         Preserve the zoning of parcels along the Interstate 44 to provide convenience uses for
                    both travelers and local population/employees located in the northern portion of the
                    City.
          •         When          applicable,           encourage             the     use      of Planned             Districts,          such       as    the     Planned
                    Industrial           Development                 Districts          and       "BP-4"           Planned          Business            Park        for     the
