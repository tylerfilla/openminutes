He shared that Public\nWorks Director Dan Howard had proposed a starting wage of $20.00 per hour for new hires                                                                                                                                              for the\nMaintenance                      Worker               I    positions               and         all     current             eligible             Public            Works             Maintenance                      III,       II,     and        I\nemployees receive a $2.00 per hour increase to their current wage.\n\nAlderman Cruts shared he, Mayor Maurath, Personnel Chair Alderman Huels, Public Works Director Dan\nHoward, and City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner met earlier in the week for further discussion of pay\nadjustments. There is an additional option proposal for consideration for pay adjustments for the Public\nWorks Department as discussed at the Personnel Committee Meeting in April 2023: a starting wage of\n$19.08 per hour for new hires for the Maintenance Worker I positions and all current eligible Public\nWorks Maintenance III, ll, and I employees receive a $1.00 per hour increase to their current wage.\n\n\n\n                                                                                                             Budget Hearing\n                                                                                                         November 16, 2023\n\f\nFurther consideration and discussion ensued regarding all current eligible employees to receive a four\npercent (4%) increase and override salary cap to any employee that would be over the maximum pay\ngrade to receive the full four percent (4%) increase for 2024.\n\nAlderman Cruts inquired on the Board's consideration of a flat amount per employee increase instead of a\nfour percent ( 4%) increase. The amount of a four percent ( 4%) increase would be $50,228 divided among\nthe twenty-three (23) eligible employees for a flat amount increase of $2, 184.00/$1.05                             per hour per\neligible employee. He feels the flat amount increase gives a                      larger increase to the       lower pay grade\nemployees.\n\nMayor Maurath shared there are other employees in other departments within the City that would                                   be\nreaching the maximum salary cap in their pay grade not just in Public Works Department that will also\nneed to be considered.\n\nAlderman Huels clarified the $1.00 per hour increase to their current wage would only be for current\neligible Public Works Maintenance III, II, and I.\n\nAlderman Wisbrock inquired if the City was running a deficit or surplus in the budget this year and if so,\nwhat is the amount. Alderman Cruts replied there is a surplus. Financial Consultant Tammy Alsop shared\nthere is a $140,000 surplus in the General Funds budget with original proposal of the starting wage of\n$20.00 per hour for new hires for the Maintenance Worker I positions and $2.00 per hour increase for\neligible Public Works employees.\n\nFinancial Consultant Tammy Alsop further overviewed the amended proposal of starting wage of $19 .08\nper hour for new hires for the Maintenance Worker I positions and $1.00 per hour increase for eligible\nPublic Works employees and further noted the proposal included reducing Public Works Maintenance\nWorkers staff from fifteen (15) to twelve (12) positions and further moving two (2) Maintenance Worker\nII positions to Maintenance Worker I positions. This amendment is a reduction of salary of approximately\n$27,800 changing the surplus in General Funds to $167,000.\n\nFinancial Consultant Tammy Alsop shared she forecasted $22,000 per month for Prop U revenue in the\nbudget conservatively, she noted the amount received in September was $50,000.\n\nAlderman      Bereitschaft     inquired    on   consideration     of leaving      the maximum         salary   cap   in place    or\neliminating cap. Alderman Cruts suggested removing maximum salary cap for 2024 budget year.\n\nMayor Maurath shared he feels over the years employees top out and the salary ranges are moved. He\nasked why have a cap? He feels the cap should be eliminated.\n\nAlderman Wisbrock suggested topics be voted on separately. There were no objections.\n\nAlderman Cruts made a motion for starting pay for Maintenance Worker I to be increased from $15.08 to\n$19.08 per hour. The motion was seconded by Alderman Bereitschaft.\n\nAlderman Wisbrock clarified this did not change salary ranges. Mayor Maurath stated for the record the new\nhire starting wage of$19.08 is for Maintenance Worker I positions only not salary ranges.\n\nAlderman Clauss inquired why salary ranges were not being changed. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner\nexpressed if the Board desires a motion can be made for salary ranges to be amended.\n\n\n                                                          Budget Hearing\n                                                        November 16, 2023\n\f\nMayor Maurath shared overriding the starting wage to $19.08 and not the salary range gives the Director the\nability to hire an employee with no experience at the base pay of $15.08. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner\nshared job postings state starting pay depends on qualifications.\n\nAlderman Huels voiced she feels salary ranges need to be adjusted as the override starting pay is                     in the\nmiddle of the range and in just a few years the employee would obtain the maximum cap of the range.\nAlderman Clauss shared she feels salary ranges need to be amended and should be done periodically to stay\ncompetitive and current with cost ofliving.\n\nAlderman Wisbrock expressed if maximum salary cap is eliminated, the range would be base pay to infinity.\nMayor Maurath shared he feels it is ridiculous when an employee caps out that the range is changed.\n\nCity Administrator Nikki Finkbiner suggested for purpose of discussion for the 2024 budget, the focus is on\nconsideration on the override of new hire starting pay increase for Maintenance Worker I to $19.08 and\naddressing issue of salary caps being maxed out that would restrict an eligible employee from the ability to\nreceive their full increase of pay. Discussion of salary ranges can be brought back for a future agenda.\n\nAfter discussion, upon the roll being called, the Board of Aldermen voted as follows:\n\n      Alderman Bereitschaft           Aye                 Alderman Clauss             Aye\n      Alderman Cruts                  Aye                 Alderman Huels              Aye\n      Alderman Wisbrock               Aye                 Alderman Maserang           Aye\n      Alderman Harrell                Aye                 Alderman Jokerst            Absent\n\nIt was announced the motion passed by the Board of Aldermen.\n\nAlderman Cruts made a motion to authorize override of salary caps for 2024 budget year only for all\neligible employees to receive full increase.

Mayor Maurath feels flat amount gives more to the lower grades and percentages gives more\nto higher levels. He feels it is more equitable for a flat amount. Aldennan Wisbrock voiced he feels flat\namount does not reward higher level employees for the work they perform.\n\nAlderman Cruts inquired if different pay grades could be given different flat amount rates for increases.\nCity Administrator Nikki Finkbiner replied yes.\n\nAlderman Clauss stated she feels the employees in the higher pay grades have a higher responsibility and\nskill levels needed and should be compensated for such.\n\nAfter discussion, Alderman Wisbrock made a motion that all current eligible employees receive a four\npercent (4%) increase.

He shared that Public Works Director Dan Howard had proposed a starting wage of $20.00 per hour for new hires for the Maintenance Worker I positions and all current eligible Public Works Maintenance III, II, and I employees receive a $2.00 per hour increase to their current wage.\n\nAlderman Cruts shared he, Mayor Maurath, Personnel Chair Alderman Huels, Public Works Director Dan Howard, and City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner met earlier in the week for further discussion of pay adjustments.
