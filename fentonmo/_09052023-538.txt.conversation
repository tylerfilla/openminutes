It was noted that while putting together the\n          draft,   Staff    found     elements     of   the    Residential     and    Commercial        Planning     Areas     that   needed\n          clarification/direction from the Commission.\n\n          Director Starck stated that the 1997 Comprehensive Plan identifies large lots within the Residential area as\n          those with a minimum of one acre.

Following       discussion,     the\n               Commission agreed to specify a minimum one-acre lot size to eliminate any ambiguity.\n\n               Discussion     was    then   held   regarding     the Commercial         Planning     Area.   Director     Starck   reminded      the\n               Commission that residential uses were discussed during the previous workshop. While the Commission\n               made clear that there was no desire to see multi-family or stand-alone apartment developments within the\n               Commercial Planning Area, the detennination was not as                       clear for mixed-use developments. Director\n               Starck stated that, because the Plan serves as a tool for future planning, the Commission should clarify\n               what their future vision might include. City Attorney Erin Seele added that it is best to be specific so that\n               the Plan can be relied on for future decision making.\n\n               Discussion ensued regarding the viability of mixed-use developments and what support they might have\n               within the community. Additionally, the Commission talked about potential tax implications if commercial\n               uses are lost to mixed-use developments. Mayor Maurath noted that more residents require more City\n               services and stated that he is not in favor of such a development if it is just to fill up vacant spaces, but\n               should it be addressed        in the Comprehensive Plan, he             would    highly encourage a proportional balance\n               between commercial and residential uses to preserve economic stability and preserve the commercial area.\n              Other Commissioners commented that retail has changed in the time since most of the commercial area\n              was developed, and while it is difficult to predict the future, it is to the benefit to the City to be flexible.\n              Mayor Maurath reiterated that a TIF was used to initiate infrastructure for a retail development in Gravois\n               Bluffs which should be considered when contemplating mixed-use.\n\n              The Commission continued to debate the pros and cons of a mixed-use development. Concerns were raised\n              about keeping with the character of the area and the impact on surrounding properties. Director Starck\n              commented that the Commission has the option to be very specific and could put parameters that limit\n              developments such         as   proportionality     of uses,    appropriate     locations, and other such constraints. City\n              Attorney     Seele    added    that it   is fine   to say    no   if the   Commission       doesn't    envision    these    types   of\n              developments, but that the Comprehensive Plan should be clear rather than staying silent.\n\n              Following discussion, it was put forward that Staff provide a draft with some of the parameters discussed\n              before a decision could          be made on whether or not to include                limited    mixed-use     in the Commercial\n              Planning     Area    of the     Comprehensive        Plan.
