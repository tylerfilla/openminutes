Interstates 44 and 270 and Missouri\nState     Highways            30    and      141     provide        Fenton       with      excellent        access       to    and     from      the     entire\nmetropolitan area.\n\nThroughout its history, the City of Fenton has maintained a small-town atmosphere through the\nbalance of new growth and the preservation of its rich heritage.                                                  With a history as a farming\ncommunity, the City endeavors to maintain the balance of a farm-feel character by promoting\nlarge      residential         lots     while        also     providing          convenient,           vibrant        commercial            areas.       Good\ntransportation, geographic location within St. Louis County, and a broad range of City services\ncontinue to attract and retain industrial, commercial, and residential sectors.\n\nThe City of Fenton is a desirable location to work, play, and live due to a multitude of factors\nincluding:\n\n      \u2022     Service from a fully staffed St. Louis County Police Precinct dedicated to the City of\n            Fenton, which is an Internationally Accredited Police Depa11ment.\n      \u2022     A zero percent (0%) municipal tax rate on personal and real property.\n      \u2022     Highly rated Rockwood and Lindbergh School Districts.\n      \u2022     Location in the Fenton Fire Protection District, which has an exceptional Class                                                             I ISO\n            rating.\n      \u2022     Proximity to interstates and highways, including Interstates 44 and 270 and Highways 30\n            and 141, placing Fenton within 20 minutes from all St. Louis Metropolitan locations.\n      \u2022     Proximity to hospitals and medical care facilities.\n      \u2022     Proximity to local and regional shopping and business districts.\n      \u2022     An extensive parks and recreation system.\n      \u2022     Service by a financially stable City government that provides multiple City services, such\n            as free residential trash/recycling services and yard waste/debris removal, snow removal,\n            and street and park maintenance.\n\nPurpose\nWith most of the City being fully developed or located in envirornnentally sensitive areas, this\nComprehensive               Development             Plan      (herein       \"Plan\")       is   intended        to   recommend             guidelines         for\nfuture development or redevelopment based on current conditions along with the future needs,\nvisions,       and     desires      of the       community.            Within       this    Plan,      as   much       attention        is   given to        the\nprotection          of    existing         land      uses      as    to     the     needs       of     possible        future       developments              or\nredevelopments. This Plan is not in itself a code document but a planning tool designed to be\nused     as    a   directive        for    City      Officials       and      Staff in       making         decisions         related      to    the    future\n\n                                                                                3\n\f\nCOMPREHENSIVE DEVELOPMENT PLAN\ndevelopment      and    redevelopment       in the    City.

Create Planning Areas that will be supported by the existing infrastructure or have the\n              capacity to support the expansion of infrastructure needed for new development or\n              redevelopment.\n         g. Create a Future Land Use Map that reflects the goals and objectives of each planning\n              area.\n         h.

Additionally, Planned Unit Developments (PUD) are encouraged\nwithin these areas      as the concept affords a flexible residential pattern of development with\nsensitivity to the landscape.\n\nTo maintain the small-town feel and farm-like character in certain areas, to protect residential\nareas from     encroachment by surrounding industrial, business,                 and   conunercial uses,      and   to\nfurther ensure the health, safety, and welfare of the residents, it has been a long-standing policy\nof the City to     separate non-residential uses         north of Horan Drive and           Wolfner Drive from\nresidential uses located to the south by creating \"buffer areas\" through zoning designations.\n\f\n~                     FENTON\n~ CITY\u00b0' PAJlKS\nCOMPREHENSIVE DEVELOPMENT PLAN\n\n                                                    3\nGoals and Objectives\nThe       goals         of the         Residential              Planning            Area         are     to     protect         ex1st111g          and      future         residential\ndevelopment from more intensive uses, protect environmentally sensitive areas, maintain safe\nand stable neighborhoods, and preserve and enhance the quality of life of the residents, all while\nretaining           the     directives            of the         1997        Comprehensive                     Plan.

This\noriginal 8-block area has now grown into a vibrant suburb of southwest St. Louis County,\nknown as the City of Fenton.                                     The rich heritage of the Olde Towne Planning Area yearns for\nrecognition                of its         past       through            appreciation,                understanding,                    and       sensitivity             to     its     unique\ncharacter and environmental concerns, specifically riverine flooding from the Meramec River\nand Fenton Creek. By taking advantage of its access to excellent road and highway networks,\nincluding Gravois Road,                                S.    Old Highway 141, State Highway                                              141, and State Highway 30,\nproximity to suitable infrastmctme and improvements, and natural and scenic attributes, the\nCity hopes to rebuild a historic image within this area. Past renovation projects like street\nimprovements and historic-deco streetlamps have gradually proven the City's conunitment and\nsupport for the                    historic area.                 With the              lack of available parking that lends itself to more\npedestrian-oriented activities and small-scale businesses, and to meet the community's desire\nto attract a unique shopping experience and more out-of-town visitors, the area should only be\nrestored or redeveloped in a manner befitting its place in the history of Fenton.\n\n                                                       4\nGoals and Objectives\nThe goals of the Olde Towne Planning Area are to encourage a mix of small-scale commercial\nand residential development while protecting the rich heritage and history of Fenton as well as a\nsense of pedestrian-oriented character. Said goals can be completed by focusing on the following\nset of objectives:\n\n        \u2022       Continue to make select public improvements, such as streetscapes, road infrastructure,\n               parks, and traffic circulation to encourage and complement private investment in the area.\n        \u2022       Continue to develop new and enhance existing networks of pedestrian trails to encourage\n               pedestrian traffic within the Planning Area.\n        \u2022      Continue to facilitate accessible sidewalks to promote pedestrian traffic, including the\n               expansion and improvements to                                           the Meramec Greenway Trail system in                                                     coordination\n               with Great Rivers Greenway.\n        \u2022      Encourage a complementary mix and diversity of uses to create a unique environment of\n               small shops, restaurants, and residential dwellings through Zoning Code regulations.\n        \u2022      Revise the adopted Olde Towne Redevelopment Plan or develop a new plan for the Olde\n               Towne area.\n        \u2022      Continue participation in the National Flood Insurance Program \"NFIP\" and adhere to the\n               City's Floodplain Regulations to mitigate flood damage.\n\n4\n  Noted changes to Olde Towne/Commercial designation from the original 1997 Comprehensive Plan:                                                                                                   The\ndivision of the Olde Towne area and Commercial area into separate Planning Areas.

In-fill        development                 and       redevelopment                   that      allows          for       higher-density\narrangements is key to accommodating new businesses. Therefore, the City seeks to carefully\nbalance the need to meet potential growth and changing industry needs with the protection of the\nadjacent Residential Planning Area and the preservation of property adjacent to Interstate 44 for\nhospitality and convenience uses.\n\n                                                6\nGoals and Objectives\nThe goals of the Business Park and Industrial Planning Area are to encourage and maintain a\nhealthy, economically viable industrial and business hub in the St. Louis metropolitan area, all\nwhile protecting nearby residential development and preserving land adjacent to Interstate 44 for\nhospitality and convenience uses.
