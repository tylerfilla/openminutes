Alderman\nMaserang seconded the motion. Upon a vote being taken, the motion passed unanimously by the Board of\nAldermen.\n\nPARKS AND RECREATION COMMITTEE -Aid Huels, Liaison\nAll recommendations from the Parks and Recreation Committee will be forwarded to the next Board Meeting\nfor approval unless otherwise noted.\n\u2022    Other items from the Parks and Recreation Department:\n     \u2022    Request for approval of the Great Rivers Greenway sign plan for the Meramec Greenway.\n          As discussed with the             Board     in March,      Great Rivers Greenway (GRG)                   is proposing upgraded\n           signage along the Meramec Greenway, including \"sticks\" and bridge graphics. Last month the City\n          approved a construction, operations, and maintenance agreement with GRG for the placement and\n          future maintenance of the proposed signage under Ordinance 4329.\n\n          The final item needed for GRG to begin the project is Board approval of the proposed sign package.\n          A sign package for discussion and comments was available for review so that GRG can finalize the\n          plan for the project.\n\n          Angelica Gutierrez, Project Manager with GRG, overviewed the sign project. Ms. Gutierrez shared\n          there are thirty (30) Greenway signs to be removed and forty-two ( 42) signs to be installed with\n          new brandage, bridge graphics, and \"sticks\". They are also coordinating with MoDOT and St.\n          Louis County Parks.           She commented that the City has done a great job maintaining the Greenway.\n\n          Alderman Bereitschaft expressed he feels there are too many proposed new signs and suggested if\n          the number can be reduced. He further inquired on what the USNG # was used for. Ms. Gutierrez\n          replied,    it is an emergency           locator code,       and   they are working with dispatchers to update                      the\n          database with new coding.\n\n          Alderman Jokerst shared she also feels there are too many proposed signs and inquired if some\n          could be combined. Ms. Gutierrez shared additional signage for decision points and guidance for\n          people not familiar with the area are being proposed. They will review to see if any signs can be\n          combined to minimize the number.\n\n          Alderman Maserang inquired                 if MoDOT had concerns with painting bridge piers with graphics.\n          Ms.    Gutierrez      shared     conceptually        no,   however,      MoDOT         is reviewing        licensing     and    mural\n          agreement that will need to be entered with GRG. Alderman Jokerst inquired affects from drainage\n          culverts from the highway on the graphics. Ms. Gutierrez replied she would inquire.\n\n          Alderman Clauss inquired if signage could be double sided to reduce the number proposed for the\n          project. Ms. Gutierrez replied that is proposed in the project.\n\n\n                                                                        2\n                                                     Board of Aldennen Committee Meeting\n                                                                  June 8, 2023\n\f\n                     Mayor Maurath shared he also believes there are too many signs proposed. He believes people\n                     utilized their mobile devices to navigate.\n\n                     Alderman Bereitschaft inquired what a sharrow sign was. Ms. Gutierrez replied it is a sign painted\n                     on the street.\n\n                     Alderman Huels expressed she was not in favor of forty-two (42) signs.\n\n                     City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner suggested to allow GRG to revise project to minimize signage\n                                                                                                                                              th\n                     and present revision to the Board at the July                                                                       13         Board of Aldermen Committee meeting for\n                     approval.\n\n                    Alderman Huels made a motion to continue to the July Board of Aldermen Committee meeting to\n                    allow GRG time to revise sign plan for the Meramec Greenway with reduced signage. The motion\n                    was seconded by Alderman Clauss. Upon a vote being taken, the motion passed unanimously by the\n                    Board of Aldermen.\n\n\u2022         Announcements from the Parks and Recreation Committee meeting:\n                                                                th\n           \u25a0        Due to the July 4                                 holiday, the July Parks and                                           Recreation Committee Meeting will be                                                             held on\n                                                                    th\n                    Wednesday, July 12                                  at 6:30 p.m.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          th\n           \u25a0        The Parks and Recreation Committee will have their annual training workshop on July 12                                                                                                                                     at 5:30\n                    p.m. in advance of the Parks and Recreation Committee Meeting.\n\n           \u25a0        Discussion regarding a bathroom in Fabick Nature Preserve was continued to allow staff to obtain\n                    additional information.\n\n          \u2022         Discussion regarding Municipal Parks Grant Commission Planning Grant was continued to allow\n                    the Committee additional time to review the Park Planning Service proposals.\n\n          \u2022         Following discussion regarding Municipal Parks Grant Commission Construction Grant, no action\n                    was taken.\n\nCity Administrator Nikki Finkbiner shared that she attended the Municipal Park Grant Commission pre-\napplication meeting. Applicants were encouraged to attend, background information on the grant process\nwas provided, and points were awarded to cities attending. Prior, grants were to assist in projects that would\nnot necessarily occur and were not included in a City plan; now, they need assurance that cities can match\nthe grant so points are provided if the project is included in a City plan.\n\nCity Administrator Nikki Finkbiner shared the Board can consider applying for Municipal Parks Grant for\nthe bathroom at Fabick Nature Preserve this year as it is the only project that would meet the needed criteria\nto get the points needed for the grant. She further noted that no one showed up for the Fabick Nature\nPreserve Bathroom Restoration pre-bid meeting, so the project would                                                                                                    have to be readvertised. The deadline\n                                                                                                                              th\nfor the construction grant application                                                        is    August              28       .   However,                 as      there         has       also         been         discussion                 for      a\nprefabricated building, Staff is working on obtaining those bids to present to the Parks and Recreation\nCommittee for recommendation. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner explained the Board can apply for the\nprefabricated building for this year, however if applied for this year, you lose points and likely would not\nget another grant the following year.                                                    If the Board wanted to restore the existing bathroom opposed to a new\nfabricated building she suggested not applying for the grant this year.\n\nCity Administrator Nikki Finkbiner further shared that the Parks and Recreation Committee discussed\nwaiting, in conjunction with planning grant, until next year, to allow time to review upcoming plan for Bud\nWeil property projects to apply for grant or parking and restroom facilities at the old Farmers Market\nlocation.\n\nMayor Maurath expressed with no one showing for pre-bid, the project does not appear to be a big enough\nproject for them to be involved in and he feels grant should be reserved for other projects.\n\n\n                                                                                                                              3\n                                                                                             Board of Aldermen Committee Meeting\n                                                                                                                    June 8, 2023\n\f\nAlderman Bereitschaft inquired factors of the grants. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner explained she was\ninformed that the prior grant for the 1-44 project points will be counted against the City, those points were\nnot   supposed        to count against           future     grants.     She    will    be   reaching       out to     the    Parks Commission              for\nclarification.\n\nNo action was taken to direct Staff to apply for a grant this year.\n\n\u2022     The Parks and Recreation Committee recommended the following:\n      \u25a0     Approval         for   staff to apply          for   funding        under the Missouri Department of Conservation\n            Community Forestry Cost Share Program for a contractor to perform a tree inventory of\n            City trees (parks and ROW).\n            Staff has contacted the Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC) regarding funding under the\n           Community Forestry Cost Share Program. Noting that the City already provides funding for the\n            removal of dead and diseased trees under the Capital Plan, it was suggested that the City consider\n           applying for funding under the Forestry Program to hire a professional service to provide a tree\n            inventory.      The tree inventory will assist the City with identifying and prioritizing trees that need to\n            be removed due to disease and/or decay or due to the invasive nature of the tree.                                         Additionally, the\n           tree inventory is usually completed within an asset management database or GIS format that is then\n           provided to the City upon completion of the survey so that progress can be easily tracked.\n\n           Per MDC, the requests for the next round of funding under the Community Forestry Cost Share\n           Program will begin on July 1, 2023.                       It is noted that applicants that apply at the beginning of the\n           funding round have a better opportunity of receiving funding.\n\n           The maximum funding allowed under an application is $49,000 per year, with a 50/50 cost share\n           (example: if awarded $49,000 by MDC, the City must provide $49,000 in cash or in-kind services\n           toward the project).            However, due to the number of applications received by MDC, it is suggested\n           that the application            have a      max request of $25,000 to                   be more competitive (likely to                   receive\n           funding).      Per MDC, quotes               will   also    need to       be obtained from            a   professional        contractor that\n           provides tree inventory services and provided with the request for funding.\n\n     \u25a0\n           Approval for staff to apply for                       funding       under the         Missouri Department of Conservation\n           Community Conservation                      Assistance Program                for    a contractor to            perform        mitigation        of\n           invasive species in Fabick Nature Preserve.\n           Staff contact MDC to discuss funding options to implement the Master Park Plan for Fabick Nature\n           Preserve.       Per MDC, the recommendation is that the City start with applying for invasive specifies\n           control, specifically honeysuckle, within the park before submitting for other project funding.\n\n           Per MDC, the best funding opportunity for invasive species control will be under the Community\n           Conservation Assistances Program and MDC will begin accepting requests for the next round of\n           funding under this program on July 1, 2023.                         Applicants that apply at the beginning of the funding\n           round have a better opportunity of receiving funding.\n\n          The maximum funding allowed under an application is $49,000 per year, with a 50/50 cost share\n          (example: if awarded $49,000 by MDC, the City must provide $49,000 in cash or in-kind services\n          toward the project). The project application will consist of the City requesting funding to hire a\n          professional service to remove the invasive species in areas identified within the proposed scope of\n          work.\n\n          Staff can work with MDC to identify areas that need invasive control and will assist in prioritizing\n          the areas before the application is submitted; however, due to the extensive invasion in the park,\n          requests for funds will most likely need to occur over multiple grant rounds as this is a long term\n          commitment           project.      Per    MDC,       quotes      will    also     need     to   be    obtained       from     a   professional\n          ecological/environmental contractor that provides                             invasive species           management services,               along\n          with the areas of priority identified, within the request for funding.\n\n                                                                             4\n                                                         Board of Aldermen Committee Meeting\n                                                                       June 8, 2023\n\f\n\u2022     Other items from the Parks and Recreation Department:\n      \u2022     Consideration of a Municipal Tree Ordinance.\n            A   sample Municipal          Tree Ordinance was            available for       review.    It is   suggested that the         Board\n            consider the adoption of a Municipal Tree Ordinance to qualify as a \"Tree City USA\" under the\n            Arbor Day Foundation. Although adoption of the Ordinance was not required in the past by the\n            Arbor Day Foundation, an Ordinance is now recommended (and will most likely be required in the\n            near future) that the City have a Tree Ordinance to meet the Tree City USA requirements.\n\n            Benefits of being a Tree City include additional grant funding through the Missouri Department of\n            Conservation (specifically the Community Forestry Cost-Share Program) at a 75%/25% cost share\n            in lieu of a 50%/50% cost share, with a maximum grant of $49,000.\n\n            It is noted     that   if adopted,      the   City   will   need    to establish a       \"Tree Board\". The Tree               Board\n           requirements can          be satisfied     by   utilizing the     Board's Public        Works/Forestry Committee              or the\n           Board     can    delegate     the   responsibilities      to the    Parks     and   Recreation      Committee.        It is   Staff's\n           understanding that the \"Forestry\" portion of the Public Works Committee was established in the\n           past to identify responsibility under the annual Tree City application; however, Staff is seeking the\n           Board's direction         on   which Committee           will be    identified    as   the Tree     Board    before drafting an\n           Ordinance for consideration and adoption.\n\n           Alderman Jokerst expressed she was in favor of the Parks and Recreation Committee for the \"Tree\n           Board\".\n\n           City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner shared Section 4(b) Term of Office will be amended to match\n           City terms of office and Section 7(a) Adjacent Owner Responsibility will be removed. Alderman\n           Maserang inquired on Section 7(b) if owner fails to maintain tree to clear of obstructions from\n           right-of-way, that the City can prune or remove tree and charge property owner. City Administrator\n           Nikki    Finkbiner explained           it will   be   referenced     back to existing municipal code that it is the\n           property owner's responsibility to keep and maintain tree on private property from blocking public\n           access.\n\n           Alderman Huels made a motion to continue to the June Board of Aldermen Committee meeting the\n           consideration of Municipal Tree Ordinance with the Parks and Recreation Committee for the \"Tree\n           Board\". The motion was seconded                   by Alderman Clauss. Upon a vote being taken, the motion\n           passed unanimously by the Board of Aldermen.\n\nFINANCE -Aid Cruts, Chairman (Wisbrock, Huels, Jokerst)\n\nAlderman Huels made a motion to open the topics to the full Board. The motion was seconded by Alderman\nJokerst. Upon a vote being taken, the motion passed unanimously by the Committee.\n\n\u2022    Consideration of Property and Casualty Renewals for 2023-2024.\n     Amy DiBlasi with Daniel and Henry Co. overviewed renewals. Amy shared the biggest challenge this\n     year is on property coverage as insurance companies have increased values, rates, and deductibles due\n     to increase of storms in the Midwest, cost of reinsurance in the market, materials, construction, labor,\n     and wind/hail claim losses.\n\n     Current property coverage through Travelers is $52,036 with an excess earthquake policy. It is noted\n     that is with $25,000 wind/hail deductible. The City has had coverage through Travelers for the past two\n     (2) years, prior to that, the City coverage was through Chubb. Renewal offers were from Travelers for\n     $122,277 and Chubb for $93,263.\n\n                                                                       5\n                                                     Board of Aldermen Committee Meeting\n                                                                  June 8, 2023\n\f\n      Due to large hail losses, in December Travelers decided that every public entity in Missouri would have\n      a $250,000 wind/hail deductible. Chubb offered a wind/hail deductible for $250,000 for RiverChase\n      building and contents only due to its size and value and a $25,000 deductible on all other City locations.\n      Lloyds of London offered a buy down on Chubb coverage for $17,864 to bring deductible down to\n      $25,000      on    RiverChase        but    no   offer    for   Travelers      coverage.       Buy    down      coverage       is optional.\n      Additionally, Chubb offered an earthquake deductible of I% or $50,000 minimum vs Travelers 2% or\n      $50,000 minimum. Amy recommended coverage through Chubb with buy down.\n\n      Amy overviewed the last nine (9) years of property loss summary. The most recent two (2) years of\n      paid losses were through Travelers totaling $54,099. The prior seven (7) years were through Chubb\n      totaling $944,122.\n\n      Amy shared the workers' compensation claims have been good (experience mod down 1.64 from                                               1.74)\n      and anticipate a large drop next year.                 She notes an average is 1.0. Public officials claims were good.\n      There is a current large auto claim with anticipated reserve of $191,123, but prior years were small.\n\n      Current workers'         compensation         is through Travelers,          prior was through Missouri Employers Mutual\n      (MEM), renewal offers were from Travelers for $133,599 and MEM for $111,896. Amy recommended\n      coverage through MEM.\n\n      Amy recommended renewals with new carriers as outlined on page 36 of the proposal totaling $289,034\n      which is a $42,020 increase over expiring.\n\n      Amy noted Crime renewal Travelers offer options: one year term for $1,669, 3-year term paid in full\n      now $4,757 (saves $250), or 3-year term paid annually for $1,669. She recommended the option to pay\n      in full for the 3 years, if feasible.\n\n      Alderman Bereitschaft expressed he feels to pay in full for the 3 years is best option and buy extra buy\n      down from Lloyds of London on hail/wind coverage.                               Alderman Clauss asked              if $25,000,000 was\n      enough earthquake coverage. Amy shared many do not buy full coverage.\n\n      Mayor Maurath inquired if a claim was made and paid if City could keep the cash instead of rebuilding.\n     Amy replied yes, generally.\n\n     Alderman Bereitschaft inquired if Chubb can guarantee pay out if there is a large number of claims\n     from their clients in a catastrophic event. Amy explained ratings companies they use are required to\n     have and had no concerns.\n\n     After discussion, Alderman Huels made a motion to forward to the June Board of Aldermen meeting\n     the consideration of Property and Casualty Renewals for 2023-2024 as recommended in proposal with buy\n     down from Lloyds of London and 3 years paid in full option for crime. The motion was seconded by\n     Alderman Jokerst. Upon a vote being taken, the motion passed unanimously by the Board of Aldermen.\n\n\u2022    Presentation of the (Draft) 2022 Audit.\n     Financial Consultant Tammy Alsop overviewed the audit and single audit that were available for review\n     and noted there were no deficiencies. She noted the City adopted provisions for GASB 87 regarding\n     leases, specifically towers; she explained the new line items under asset-lease receivable and under\n     deferred inflows of resources-lease receivable. She noted that LAGERS rate decreased this year due to\n     overfunding.\n\n     Alderman Jokerst inquired what corrected/uncorrected misstatements represented. Financial Consultant\n     Tammy Alsop explained differences that were                           minor unaccrued          amounts that did           not need      to be\n     adjusted such as December receivables for courts and reimbursement for legal expenses.\n\n                                                                         6\n                                                      Board of Aldennen Committee Meeting\n                                                                    June 8, 2023\n\f\n           Alderman Huels made a motion to forward to the June Board of Aldermen meeting the 2022 audit. The\n           motion was seconded by Alderman Maserang. Upon a vote being taken, the motion passed unanimously\n           by the Board of Aldermen.\n\n  \u2022        April 30, 2023, Monthly Financial Report (Draft).\n           Alderman Huels summarized the draft monthly financial report.\n\n  \u2022        Consideration of a request for a Purchasing Credit Card for the Community Development Director.\n           Currently, the following positions have City Purchasing Credit Cards through Commerce Bank: City\n           Administrator, City Clerk, Court Administrator, Public Works Director, Recreation Supervisor, and\n           Building and Grounds Maintenance Technician. The highest credit limit is $5,000.\n\n           It is requested that a card also be issued to the Community Development Director with a $2,500 credit\n           limit. This card will mainly be utilized to purchase office supplies, conference/training fees, and other\n           miscellaneous purchases (such as online deed searches). If approved, the employee will be required to\n           sign the City Credit Card Usage Agreement, as required by the City's Financial Policy.\n\n          After discussion, Alderman Huels made a motion to forward to the June Board of Aldermen meeting\n          the consideration of a request for a Purchasing Credit Card for the Community Development Director. The\n          motion was seconded by Alderman Harrell. Upon a vote being taken, the motion passed unanimously by\n          the Board of Aldermen.\n\n\u2022         Consideration of amendments to Municipal Code providing for no automatic adjustments on the\n          City's license tax for water, electric, gas, and telephone companies.\n          The City received notice from the Public Service Commission of the State of Missouri pursuant to\n          Section 393.275 RSMo. that Missouri American Water has raised its rates effective May 11, 2023.\n\n          Pursuant to Section 393.275 RSMo., within sixty (60) days of the effective date of such rate increase,\n          the City's tax rate shall be adjusted (in this case reduced), or the City must enact an Ordinance to\n          maintain its tax rate (no reduction). Based on the above, it is suggested that the Board consider adopting\n          the Ordinance that was available for review.\n\n          Alderman Huels made a motion to forward to the June Board of Aldermen meeting the consideration of\n          amendments to Municipal Code providing for no                                                                          automatic adjustments on the City's license tax for\n          water, electric, gas, and telephone companies.

The current carpet (except for                                                         a   few     areas)      is approximately\n      twenty-three (23) years old. Staff requested a local Fenton flooring vendor (Gateway Flooring), that the\n      City has utilized in the past to replace carpet, provide an estimated cost to remove and replace the\n      existing carpet/cove base in both buildings with new carpet tiles and cove base.\n\n      The estimates are as follows:\n      \u2022      City Hall/Police Department and Community Development Departments: $19,748 (This quote does\n             not include the Captain's office, Mayor's office, Board Room, former library space and hallway, or\n             vestibules as these areas are provided in a separate quote or have newer carpet that does not need to\n             be replaced).\n\n      \u2022      Vestibules at City                Hall     and     Community             Development:             $5,012 (This            is a     separate quote             as   a\n            different/more durable type of carpet is quoted).\n\n      \u2022     Board Room (Alternate Quote): $9,810 (This was provided as an alternate quote as the carpet in the\n            Board Room is newer than the rest of the building, but the Board may desire to update).\n\n      Total Estimated Cost (including alternates): $34,570.\n\n\n                                                                                        8\n                                                                 Board of Aldennen Committee Meeting\n                                                                                 June 8, 2023\n\f\n       The carpet replacement will need to occur in phases to mitigate disruption of City services. Based on\n       the above, would the Board like to go out for a formal bid for the carpet replacement and would the\n       Board like to include the Board Room as an alternate? Also, it is suggested that the Board also consider\n       painting the areas/offices scheduled for the new carpet before the new carpet is placed (with the cove\n       removed). This can also be put out for bid.\n\n      It is also noted that the bid does not include moving furniture, and as the carpet replacement will be\n      done in phases, it is suggested that a moving company is hired to assist with the heavy items.\n\n      Mayor       Maurath        inquired      why     cove     molding       would      need     to   be    replaced.      Alderman         Bereitschaft\n      explained        it should       be    replaced       due    to    a gap      or   unable      to    place     new     carpet     under      it from\n      height/thickness difference.\n\n      Alderman         Clauss inquired          if movement and              renovations for         Community           Development and             Police\n      Department offices would affect the install of new carpet. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner replied\n      that it should not.\n\n      After discussion, Alderman Jokerst made a final motion to approve to go out for formal bid for carpet\n      and    cove replacement for               City    Hall/Police       and    Community           Development          Buildings,       painting and\n      alternate of hiring a moving company. The motion was seconded by Alderman Clauss. Upon a vote\n      being taken, the motion passed unanimously by the Board of Aldermen.\n\n\u2022     Consideration of contract for Court Reporting services.\n      The City is required to have a Court Reporter present at all Board of Adjustment Meetings to take the\n      official record (and transcribe the meeting if requested). The City's former Court Reporter (for more\n      than twenty (20) years) is no longer available. Staff reached out to a Court Reporter, Sue Moody, that is\n      used    by the City's Prosecuting Attorney's office, and                           she stated      she would be willing to attend the\n      meetings at a rate of $100 per hour (the former rate was $90 per hour).\n\n      Based on the above, Staff is requesting that the Board consider a contract with Sue Moody to provide\n      the City's needed Court Reporter services. Noting that transcription expenses are not included                                                 in her\n      $ I 00 per hour rate.\n\n      Mayor Maurath inquired if the Board wanted to move forward with a contract or pay for services as\n      needed. City Attorney Erin Seele advised without a contract; expenses have to be specifically budgeted\n     to qualify and comply with RSMo. 432.070.\n\n     After discussion, Alderman Huels made a motion to forward to the June Board of Aldermen meeting\n     the consideration of contract for Court Reporting services. The motion was seconded by Alderman\n     Maserang. Upon a vote being taken, the motion passed unanimously by the Board of Aldermen.\n\n\u2022    Consideration of amendments to Chapter 600, Intoxicating Liquor, of the Municipal Code.\n     Proposed amendments to                  the   City's Municipal           Code related to Chapter 600                  Intoxicating Liquor for\n     review, discussion, and consideration by the Board were available for review.                                           The code changes are\n     summarized as follows:\n\n     \u25a0     Amending Section 600.020 License Required - Classes of Licenses and Fees.\n     \u25a0     Updating classifications and costs in line with Missouri Division of Alcohol and Tobacco Control.\n           Removing Section 600.020 (C)(5) and Section 600.044 Independence Day liquor permit as it is\n           covered under other liquor licensing.\n     \u25a0     Amending Sunday sales hours as needed within the Code.\n\n\n                                                                              9\n                                                         Board of Aldennen Committee Meeting\n                                                                       June 8, 2023\n\f\n     Alderman Jokerst made a motion to forward to the June Board of Aldermen meeting the consideration\n     of amendments to Chapter 600, Intoxicating Liquor, of the Municipal Code. The motion was seconded\n     by Alderman Bereitschaft. Upon a vote being taken, the motion passed unanimously by the Board of\n     Aldermen.\n\n\u2022    Consideration of amendments to Chapter 205, Offenses, of the Municipal Code.\n     The City's Prosecuting Attorney is requesting that the Board consider amending the Municipal Code\n     under Chapter 205, Offenses, Article II, Offenses Against The Person, to add a new Section 205.080\n     addressing    Miscellaneous      Health   and   Safety   Offenses.    A draft   Ordinance     for consideration     was\n     available for review.\n\n     Mayor Maurath inquired if the numbering was correct and in line with current code numbering, as this\n     is a new section to the Code. City Attorney Erin Seele stated she would verify.\n\n     City Attorney Erin Seele explained offenses against the person are crimes that involve violent acts or\n     trigger a fear of bodily harm to another person. This is a broad range of offenses when a person is\n     endangering another person for prosecution action.\n\n     Captain Lawson shared per Section l(A) \"A person commits the offense of miscellaneous health &\n     safety if he/she does or causes any action that endangers or potentially dangers the health and safety of\n     another person. A person who violates this provision is subject to the penalties pursuant to Section\n     100 .120 of this Code\". It allows action against the perpetrator.\n\n     After discussion, Alderman Clauss made a motion to forward to the June Board of Aldermen meeting\n     the consideration of amendments to Chapter 205, Offenses, of the Municipal Code. The motion was\n     seconded by Alderman Harrell. Upon a vote being taken, the motion passed unanimously by the Board\n     of Aldermen.\n\n\u2022    Consideration of a request for approval of an Amusement License Renewal for Swing-A-Round\n     Fun Town.\n     The City Clerk issues the amusement machine licenses, costing $15 per machine, annually. Section\n     640.040(E) of the Municipal Code requires that the Board review the renewal licenses issued to an\n    amusement park. Swing-A-Round Fun Town at 335 Skinker Lane, meets this definition and currently\n     has fifty-seven (57) machines. Their site plan, on file with the Community Development Department,\n    allows for up to one hundred two ( 102) machines. It is recommended that the Board authorize approval\n    of the licenses for Swing-A-Round Fun Town.\n\n    After discussion, Alderman Huels made a motion to forward to the June Board of Aldermen meeting\n    the consideration of a request for approval of an Amusement License Renewal for Swing-A-Round Fun\n    Town. The motion was seconded by Alderman Jokerst. Upon a vote being taken, the motion passed\n    unanimously by the Board of Aldermen.\n\n\u2022   Consideration of a        request to     amend    the agreement with         Specialty Mailing, Inc.        to provide\n    printing services for the City's monthly newsletter.\n    On March 23, 2023, the Board approved Ordinance 4307 which authorized the Mayor to execute an\n    agreement with Specialty Mailing to provide printing services for the City's monthly newsletter.\n\n    Per the agreement, under \"Special Provisions\", Specialty Mailing was to provide a Performance and\n    Maintenance Bond. In the past this was not a requirement under the printing services contract (waived\n    by the Board); however, Specialty Mailing did not request this provision to be waived for 2023 bid as\n    they stated they would be able to obtain the needed bond.\n\n\n                                                             10\n                                             Board of Aldennen Committee Meeting\n                                                         June 8, 2023\n\f\n               Specialty Mailing has been working to obtain the required bond since the end of March, but have been\n              unable to do so; therefore, they are requesting that the Board consider amending the current agreement\n              approved under Ordinance 4307 to remove the Special Provision requiring the bond, similar to the\n              previous contract.\n              City Attorney Erin Seele explained requirements of bond and expressed she believes the risk is low for\n              the printing service ofthe newsletter.\n              Alderman         Bereitschaft        made      a   motion      to   forward       to   the   June     Board      of Aldermen           meeting       the\n              consideration of a request to amend the agreement with Specialty Mailing, Inc.                                               to provide printing\n              services       for   the    City's      monthly       newsletter        to   waive      the    Performance           and    Maintenance          Bond\n              requirement. The motion was seconded by Alderman Harrell.                                       Upon a vote being taken, the motion\n              passed unanimously by the Board of Aldermen.\n        EXECUTIVE SESSION\n        There was no executive session held.\n        ADJOURNMENT\n        At 9: 17 p.m. with no other business before the Board, Alderman Huels made a motion to adjourn.

Alderman Maserang seconded the motion. Upon a vote being taken, the motion passed unanimously by the Board of Aldermen.\n\nPARKS AND RECREATION COMMITTEE - Aid Huels, Liaison\nAll recommendations from the Parks and Recreation Committee will be forwarded to the next Board Meeting for approval unless otherwise noted.\n\u2022 Other items from the Parks and Recreation Department:\n     \u2022 Request for approval of the Great Rivers Greenway sign plan for the Meramec Greenway. As discussed with the Board in March, Great Rivers Greenway (GRG) is proposing upgraded signage along the Meramec Greenway, including \"sticks\" and bridge graphics. Last month the City approved a construction, operations, and maintenance agreement with GRG for the placement and future maintenance of the proposed signage under Ordinance 4329.\n\n          The final item needed for GRG to begin the project is Board approval of the proposed sign package.\n          A sign package for discussion and comments was available for review so that GRG can finalize the plan for the project.\n\n          Angelica Gutierrez, Project Manager with GRG, overviewed the sign project. Ms. Gutierrez shared there are thirty (30) Greenway signs to be removed and forty-two (42) signs to be installed with new brandage, bridge graphics, and \"sticks\". They are also coordinating with MoDOT and St. Louis County Parks. She commented that the City has done a great job maintaining the Greenway.\n\n          Alderman Bereitschaft expressed he feels there are too many proposed new signs and suggested if the number can be reduced. He further inquired on what the USNG # was used for. Ms. Gutierrez replied, it is an emergency locator code, and they are working with dispatchers to update the database with new coding.\n\n          Alderman Jokerst shared she also feels there are too many proposed signs and inquired if some could be combined. Ms. Gutierrez shared additional signage for decision points and guidance for people not familiar with the area are being proposed. They will review to see if any signs can be combined to minimize the number.\n\n          Alderman Maserang inquired if MoDOT had concerns with painting bridge piers with graphics. Ms. Gutierrez shared conceptually no, however, MoDOT is reviewing licensing and mural agreement that will need to be entered with GRG. Alderman Jokerst inquired affects from drainage culverts from the highway on the graphics. Ms. Gutierrez replied she would inquire.\n\n          Alderman Clauss inquired if signage could be double sided to reduce the number proposed for the project. Ms. Gutierrez replied that is proposed in the project.\n\nMayor Maurath shared he also believes there are too many signs proposed. He believes people utilized their mobile devices to navigate.\n\nAlderman Bereitschaft inquired what a sharrow sign was. Ms. Gutierrez replied it is a sign painted on the street.\n\nAlderman Huels expressed she was not in favor of forty-two (42) signs.\n\nCity Administrator Nikki Finkbiner suggested to allow GRG to revise project to minimize signage and present revision to the Board at the July 13th Board of Aldermen Committee meeting for approval.\n\nAlderman Huels made a motion to continue to the July Board of Aldermen Committee meeting to allow GRG time to revise sign plan for the Meramec Greenway with reduced signage. The motion was seconded by Alderman Clauss. Upon a vote being taken, the motion passed unanimously by the Board of Aldermen.\n\n\u2022 Announcements from the Parks and Recreation Committee meeting:\n          \u25a0 Due to the July 4 holiday, the July Parks and Recreation Committee Meeting will be held on Wednesday, July 12th at 6:30 p.m.\n\n          \u25a0 The Parks and Recreation Committee will have their annual training workshop on July 12th at 5:30 p.m. in advance of the Parks and Recreation Committee Meeting.\n\n          \u25a0 Discussion regarding a bathroom in Fabick Nature Preserve was continued to allow staff to obtain additional information.\n\n          \u2022 Discussion regarding Municipal Parks Grant Commission Planning Grant was continued to allow the Committee additional time to review the Park Planning Service proposals.\n\n          \u2022 Following discussion regarding Municipal Parks Grant Commission Construction Grant, no action was taken.\n\nCity Administrator Nikki Finkbiner shared that she attended the Municipal Park Grant Commission pre-application meeting. Applicants were encouraged to attend, background information on the grant process was provided, and points were awarded to cities attending. Prior, grants were to assist in projects that would not necessarily occur and were not included in a City plan; now, they need assurance that cities can match the grant so points are provided if the project is included in a City plan.\n\nCity Administrator Nikki Finkbiner shared the Board can consider applying for Municipal Parks Grant for the bathroom at Fabick Nature Preserve this year as it is the only project that would meet the needed criteria to get the points needed for the grant. She further noted that no one showed up for the Fabick Nature Preserve Bathroom Restoration pre-bid meeting, so the project would have to be readvertised. The deadline for the construction grant application is August 28th. However, as there has also been discussion for a prefabricated building, Staff is working on obtaining those bids to present to the Parks and Recreation Committee for recommendation. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner explained the Board can apply for the prefabricated building for this year, however if applied for this year, you lose points and likely would not get another grant the following year. If the Board wanted to restore the existing bathroom opposed to a new fabricated building she suggested not applying for the grant this year.\n\nCity Administrator Nikki Finkbiner further shared that the Parks and Recreation Committee discussed waiting, in conjunction with planning grant, until next year, to allow time to review upcoming plan for Bud Weil property projects to apply for grant or parking and restroom facilities at the old Farmers Market location.\n\nMayor Maurath expressed with no one showing for pre-bid, the project does not appear to be a big enough project for them to be involved in and he feels grant should be reserved for other projects.\n\nAlderman Bereitschaft inquired factors of the grants. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner explained she was informed that the prior grant for the I-44 project points will be counted against the City, those points were not supposed to count against future grants. She will be reaching out to the Parks Commission for clarification.\n\nNo action was taken to direct Staff to apply for a grant this year.\n\n\u2022 The Parks and Recreation Committee recommended the following:\n      \u25a0 Approval for staff to apply for funding under the Missouri Department of Conservation Community Forestry Cost Share Program for a contractor to perform a tree inventory of City trees (parks and ROW).\n           Staff has contacted the Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC) regarding funding under the Community Forestry Cost Share Program. Noting that the City already provides funding for the removal of dead and diseased trees under the Capital Plan, it was suggested that the City consider applying for funding under the Forestry Program to hire a professional service to provide a tree inventory. The tree inventory will assist the City with identifying and prioritizing trees that need to be removed due to disease and/or decay or due to the invasive nature of the tree. Additionally, the tree inventory is usually completed within an asset management database or GIS format that is then provided to the City upon completion of the survey so that progress can be easily tracked.\n\n           Per MDC, the requests for the next round of funding under the Community Forestry Cost Share Program will begin on July 1, 2023. It is noted that applicants that apply at the beginning of the funding round have a better opportunity of receiving funding.\n\n           The maximum funding allowed under an application is $49,000 per year, with a 50/50 cost share (example: if awarded $49,000 by MDC, the City must provide $49,000 in cash or in-kind services toward the project). However, due to the number of applications received by MDC, it is suggested that the application have a max request of $25,000 to be more competitive (likely to receive funding). Per MDC, quotes will also need to be obtained from a professional contractor that provides tree inventory services and provided with the request for funding.\n\n     \u25a0 Approval for staff to apply for funding under the Missouri Department of Conservation Community Conservation Assistance Program for a contractor to perform mitigation of invasive species in Fabick Nature Preserve.\n           Staff contact MDC to discuss funding options to implement the Master Park Plan for Fabick Nature Preserve. Per MDC, the recommendation is that the City start with applying for invasive specifies control, specifically honeysuckle, within the park before submitting for other project funding.\n\n           Per MDC, the best funding opportunity for invasive species control will be under the Community Conservation Assistance Program and MDC will begin accepting requests for the next round of funding under this program on July 1, 2023. Applicants that apply at the beginning of the funding round have a better opportunity of receiving funding.\n\n          The maximum funding allowed under an application is $49,000 per year, with a 50/50 cost share (example: if awarded $49,000 by MDC, the City must provide $49,000 in cash or in-kind services toward the project). The project application will consist of the City requesting funding to hire a professional service to remove the invasive species in areas identified within the proposed scope of work.\n\n          Staff can work with MDC to identify areas that need invasive control and will assist in prioritizing the areas before the application is submitted; however, due to the extensive invasion in the park, requests for funds will most likely need to occur over multiple grant rounds as this is a long-term commitment project. Per MDC, quotes will also need to be obtained from a professional ecological/environmental contractor that provides invasive species management services, along with the areas of priority identified, within the request for funding.\n\n\u2022 Other items from the Parks and Recreation Department:\n      \u2022 Consideration of a Municipal Tree Ordinance.\n            A sample Municipal Tree Ordinance was available for review. It is suggested that the Board consider the adoption of a Municipal Tree Ordinance to qualify as a \"Tree City USA\" under the Arbor Day Foundation. Although adoption of the Ordinance was not required in the past by the Arbor Day Foundation, an Ordinance is now recommended (and will most likely be required in the near future) that the City has a Tree Ordinance to meet the Tree City USA requirements.\n\n            Benefits of being a Tree City include additional grant funding through the Missouri Department of Conservation (specifically the Community Forestry Cost-Share Program) at a 75%/25% cost share in lieu of a 50%/50% cost share, with a maximum grant of $49,000.\n\n            It is noted that if adopted, the City will need to establish a \"Tree Board\". The Tree Board requirements can be satisfied by utilizing the Board's Public Works/Forestry Committee or the Board can delegate the responsibilities to the Parks and Recreation Committee. It is Staff's understanding that the \"Forestry\" portion of the Public Works Committee was established in the past to identify responsibility under the annual Tree City application; however, Staff is seeking the Board's direction on which Committee will be identified as the Tree Board before drafting an Ordinance for consideration and adoption.\n\n           Alderman Jokerst expressed she was in favor of the Parks and Recreation Committee for the \"Tree Board\".\n\n           City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner shared Section 4(b) Term of Office will be amended to match City terms of office and Section 7(a) Adjacent Owner Responsibility will be removed. Alderman Maserang inquired on Section 7(b) if the owner fails to maintain tree to clear of obstructions from the right-of-way, that the City can prune or remove the tree and charge the property owner. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner explained it will be referenced back to the existing municipal code that it is the property owner's responsibility to keep and maintain the tree on private property from blocking public access.\n\n           Alderman Huels made a motion to continue to the June Board of Aldermen Committee meeting the consideration of Municipal Tree Ordinance with the Parks and Recreation Committee for the \"Tree Board\". The motion was seconded by Alderman Clauss. Upon a vote being taken, the motion passed unanimously by the Board of Aldermen.\n\nFINANCE - Aid Cruts, Chairman (Wisbrock, Huels, Jokerst)\n\nAlderman Huels made a motion to open the topics to the full Board. The motion was seconded by Alderman Jokerst. Upon a vote being taken, the motion passed unanimously by the Committee.\n\n\u2022 Consideration of Property and Casualty Renewals for 2023-2024.\n     Amy DiBlasi with Daniel and Henry Co. overviewed renewals. Amy shared the biggest challenge this year is on property coverage as insurance companies have increased values, rates, and deductibles due to the increase of storms in the Midwest, cost of reinsurance in the market, materials, construction, labor, and wind/hail claim losses.\n\n     Current property coverage through Travelers is $52,036 with an excess earthquake policy. It is noted that is with $25,000 wind/hail deductible. The City has had coverage through Travelers for the past two (2) years, prior to that, the City coverage was through Chubb. Renewal offers were from Travelers for $122,277 and Chubb for $93,263.\n\n      Due to large hail losses, in December Travelers decided that every public entity in Missouri would have a $250,000 wind/hail deductible. Chubb offered a wind/hail deductible for $250,000 for RiverChase building and contents only due to its size and value and a $25,000 deductible on all other City locations. Lloyds of London offered a buy down on Chubb coverage for $17,864 to bring the deductible down to $25,000 on RiverChase but no offer for Travelers coverage. Buy down coverage is optional. Additionally, Chubb offered an earthquake deductible of 1% or $50,000 minimum vs. Travelers 2% or $50,000 minimum. Amy recommended coverage through Chubb with buy down.\n\n      Amy overviewed the last nine (9) years of property loss summary. The most recent two (2) years of paid losses were through Travelers totaling $54,099. The prior seven (7) years were through Chubb totaling $944,122.\n\n      Amy shared the workers' compensation claims have been good (experience mod down 1.64 from 1.74) and anticipate a large drop next year. She notes an average is 1.0. Public officials claims were good. There is a current large auto claim with anticipated reserve of $191,123, but prior years were small.\n\n      Current workers' compensation is through Travelers, prior was through Missouri Employers Mutual (MEM), renewal offers were from Travelers for $133,599 and MEM for $111,896. Amy recommended coverage through MEM.\n\n      Amy recommended renewals with new carriers as outlined on page 36 of the proposal totaling $289,034 which is a $42,020 increase over expiring.\n\n      Amy noted Crime renewal Travelers offer options: one year term for $1,669, 3-year term paid in full now $4,757 (saves $250), or 3-year term paid annually for $1,669. She recommended the option to pay in full for the 3 years, if feasible.\n\n      Alderman Bereitschaft expressed he feels to pay in full for the 3 years is the best option and buy extra buy down from Lloyds of London on hail/wind coverage. Alderman Clauss asked if $25,000,000 was enough earthquake coverage. Amy shared many do not buy full coverage.\n\n      Mayor Maurath inquired if a claim was made and paid if the City could keep the cash instead of rebuilding. Amy replied yes, generally.\n\n      Alderman Bereitschaft inquired if Chubb can guarantee payout if there is a large number of claims from their clients in a catastrophic event.

The current carpet (except for a few areas) is approximately twenty-three (23) years old. Staff requested a local Fenton flooring vendor (Gateway Flooring), that the City has utilized in the past to replace carpet, provide an estimated cost to remove and replace the existing carpet/cove base in both buildings with new carpet tiles and cove base.\n\nThe estimates are as follows:\n\u2022 City Hall/Police Department and Community Development Departments: $19,748 (This quote does not include the Captain's office, Mayor's office, Board Room, former library space and hallway, or vestibules as these areas are provided in a separate quote or have newer carpet that does not need to be replaced).\n\n\u2022 Vestibules at City Hall and Community Development: $5,012 (This is a separate quote as a different/more durable type of carpet is quoted).\n\n\u2022 Board Room (Alternate Quote): $9,810 (This was provided as an alternate quote as the carpet in the Board Room is newer than the rest of the building, but the Board may desire to update).\n\nTotal Estimated Cost (including alternates): $34,570.\n\nThe carpet replacement will need to occur in phases to mitigate disruption of City services.

This can also be put out for bid.\n\nIt is also noted that the bid does not include moving furniture, and as the carpet replacement will be done in phases, it is suggested that a moving company is hired to assist with the heavy items.\n\nMayor Maurath inquired why cove molding would need to be replaced. Alderman Bereitschaft explained it should be replaced due to a gap or unable to place new carpet under it from height/thickness difference.\n\nAlderman Clauss inquired if movement and renovations for Community Development and Police Department offices would affect the install of new carpet.
