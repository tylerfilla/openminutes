A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department.\n               She explained that the Petitioner is requesting to add an Indoor Limited Recreational Facility to\n               the \"BP-2\" Business Park District as a Use allowed by Special Use Permit and noted that it is\n               neither a Permitted Use nor a Use allowed by Special Use Permit in the district. The Commission\n               was reminded that this Petition is in conjunction with the following case which is a request to\n               operate      an   Indoor Limited Recreational                  Facility at a specific property;                however,        this   request\n               should consider the appropriateness                     of the use        in the     district as     it would apply to            the   entire\n               district.\n\n               The Petitioner, Lynn and Aaron Becker approached.                                 Lynn Becker explained that they are the\n               franchise owners of D-Bat. They saw an opportunity to bring this type of facility to Fenton and it\n               will be the first one in Missouri. The Petitioners stated they had visited other locations in other\n               districts but found a location in \"BP-2\" that fit the requirements of the franchise.\n\n               The Commission discussed the location and purpose of the \"BP-2\" District, other properties and\n               uses in \"BP-2\", and the appropriateness of the requested use to the district. They also discussed\n               other districts where this use is permitted or allowed by SUP and their similarities to the \"BP-2\"\n               District. Mayor Maurath stated that he struggles with amending the when this use may be located\n               in seven other districts.\n\n               Following discussion, Chairperson Yeoman made a motion to APPROVE CASE 2023-TXT-\n               06 as drafted. Commissioner Wisbrock seconded the motion.\n\n               Roll Call:\n               Chairperson Callan Yeoman                              Aye\n               Vice-Chairperson Kevin Sherrel                         Aye\n               Secretary Deborah Abbott                               Aye\n               Commissioner Bill Voorhees                             Aye\n               Commissioner Warren Wisbrock                           Aye\n               Commissioner Bill Glover                               Absent\n               Commissioner Linda Nelson                              Aye\n               Commissioner John Bielicki                             Absent\n\f\nPlanning and Zoning Commission Meeting                                                                            Page3\nJuly 11, 2023\n\n             Alderman Ron Harrell                          Aye\n             Mayor Joe Maurath                             Nay\n\n             7 Ayes; 1 Nay; 2 Absent:          Motion APPROVED\n\n\n             CASE 2023-SUP-10: A Petition by D-Bat Academics for a Special Use Permit to operate an\n             Indoor Limited Recreational Facility at 2130 Bowles Avenue. The property is addressed as\n             1297 North Highway Drive and is zoned \"BP-2\" Business Park District.\n\n             Community       Development       Director    Amy     Starck   gave    a summary       of the   Staff report     to the\n             Commission. A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department.\n             She stated that this request is in conjunction with the previous case requesting the use be allowed\n             by Special Use Permit in the \"BP-2\" District.\n\n             The Petitioner, Lynn Becker, expressed that St.              Louis is a baseball city and Fenton is an ideal\n             home for the proposed facility. Ms. Becker explained the proposed franchise, D-Bat Academics,\n             will host    baseball    and   softball   training   and   camps     as well    as have     batting   cages    to rent.\n             Additionally, the facility will host tournaments that will bring people to the area. D-Bat will also\n             offer a retail space selling baseball and softball equipment in partnership with Rawlings, adding\n             that purchases can be made without using the facility or can be made online. The retail component\n             of the facility will not cause any traffic concerns.\n\n             Lindsey Neighbor, Senior Director of Marketing with Rawlings approached. She explained that\n             D-Bat is a good representative of the Rawlings Brand and is the first business partnership that\n             Rawlings has entered.\n\n             The Commission discussed traffic flow into the area as                  this is housed in an office/warehouse\n             building. Billy Spence, Newmark Zimmer and agent for the Petitioners, explained they evaluated\n             the feasibility of the proposed facility         in this type of building adding that truck traffic will be\n             rerouted around the striped parking area to prevent any issues.\n\n             Following discussion, Chairperson Yeoman read aloud the conditions of approval. The Petitioner\n             agreed to all.\n\n             Conditions of Approval:\n                   1.

A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department.\n                She explained that as the Code is written now, some public attraction events may be exempt from\n               a Special Event Permit if certain requirements are met (less than 48 hours and no inflatables or\n               mechanical/amusement devices proposed).                            Staff is requesting to            remove these types of events\n               from the exemption since they can potentially draw large crowds that may cause parking, traffic,\n               and other safety concerns. Staff is also requesting to add Food Truck Events to the definition of a\n               Public Attraction. After discussion, the Commission amended the term \"Food Truck Events\" to\n               \"events centered around Food Trucks\" for clarity.\n\n               Chairperson Yeoman made a motion to APPROVE CASE 2023-TXT-07 with the suggested\n               amendment.

She explained that this use was added as a SUP to the \"BP-3\" District in 2017, valid\n                        for one year, to allow K&K Supply to lease a portion of their property to Beyerly RV to store\n                        RVs during peak times of the year. As the SUP has not been renewed since 2019, it is requested\n                        that the use be removed from the Land Use Matrix.\n\n                        Alderman Harrell notified the Commission that his brother works for K&K Supply, and while he\n                        feels this would not prevent his ability to vote impartially, he would recuse himself from the vote\n                        in the interest of transparency.\n\n                        Following discussion, Chairperson Yeoman made a motion to APPROVE CASE 2023-TXT-\n                        08 as drafted.

A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department. She explained that the Petitioner is requesting to add an Indoor Limited Recreational Facility to the \"BP-2\" Business Park District as a Use allowed by Special Use Permit and noted that it is neither a Permitted Use nor a Use allowed by Special Use Permit in the district. The Commission was reminded that this Petition is in conjunction with the following case which is a request to operate an Indoor Limited Recreational Facility at a specific property; however, this request should consider the appropriateness of the use in the district as it would apply to the entire district.\n\nThe Petitioner, Lynn and Aaron Becker approached. Lynn Becker explained that they are the franchise owners of D-Bat. They saw an opportunity to bring this type of facility to Fenton and it will be the first one in Missouri. The Petitioners stated they had visited other locations in other districts but found a location in \"BP-2\" that fit the requirements of the franchise.\n\nThe Commission discussed the location and purpose of the \"BP-2\" District, other properties and uses in \"BP-2\", and the appropriateness of the requested use to the district. They also discussed other districts where this use is permitted or allowed by SUP and their similarities to the \"BP-2\" District. Mayor Maurath stated that he struggles with amending the when this use may be located in seven other districts.\n\nFollowing discussion, Chairperson Yeoman made a motion to APPROVE CASE 2023-TXT-06 as drafted.

The property is addressed as 1297 North Highway Drive and is zoned \"BP-2\" Business Park District.\n\nCommunity Development Director Amy Starck gave a summary of the Staff report to the Commission. A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department. She stated that this request is in conjunction with the previous case requesting the use be allowed by Special Use Permit in the \"BP-2\" District.\n\nThe Petitioner, Lynn Becker, expressed that St. Louis is a baseball city and Fenton is an ideal home for the proposed facility. Ms. Becker explained the proposed franchise, D-Bat Academics, will host baseball and softball training and camps as well as have batting cages to rent. Additionally, the facility will host tournaments that will bring people to the area. D-Bat will also offer a retail space selling baseball and softball equipment in partnership with Rawlings, adding that purchases can be made without using the facility or can be made online. The retail component of the facility will not cause any traffic concerns.\n\nLindsey Neighbor, Senior Director of Marketing with Rawlings approached. She explained that D-Bat is a good representative of the Rawlings Brand and is the first business partnership that Rawlings has entered.\n\nThe Commission discussed traffic flow into the area as this is housed in an office/warehouse building. Billy Spence, Newmark Zimmer and agent for the Petitioners, explained they evaluated the feasibility of the proposed facility in this type of building adding that truck traffic will be rerouted around the striped parking area to prevent any issues.\n\nFollowing discussion, Chairperson Yeoman read aloud the conditions of approval. The Petitioner agreed to all.\n\nConditions of Approval:\n1. This Special Use Permit is solely for D-Bat Academics, to operate an Indoor Limited Recreational Facility at 2130 Bowles Avenue as indicated on plans dated June 12, 2023.\n2. Minimally, an Occupancy Permit will be required before the space is occupied. The site plan shall be amended to indicate the required number of Accessible spaces in compliance with Section 430.140 before Occupancy will be issued.\n3.

A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department. She explained that as the Code is written now, some public attraction events may be exempt from a Special Event Permit if certain requirements are met (less than 48 hours and no inflatables or mechanical/amusement devices proposed). Staff is requesting to remove these types of events from the exemption since they can potentially draw large crowds that may cause parking, traffic, and other safety concerns. Staff is also requesting to add Food Truck Events to the definition of a Public Attraction. After discussion, the Commission amended the term \"Food Truck Events\" to \"events centered around Food Trucks\" for clarity.\n\nChairperson Yeoman made a motion to APPROVE CASE 2023-TXT-07 with the suggested amendment. Secretary Abbott seconded the motion.\n\nRoll Call:\nChairperson Callan Yeoman Aye\nVice-Chairperson Kevin Sherrel Aye\nSecretary Deborah Abbott Aye\nCommissioner Bill Voorhees Aye\nCommissioner Warren Wisbrock Aye\nCommissioner Bill Glover Absent\nCommissioner Linda Nelson Aye\nCommissioner John Bielicki Absent\nAlderman Ron Harrell Aye\nMayor Joe Maurath Aye\n\n8 Ayes; 0 Nays; 2 Absent: Motion APPROVED\n\nCASE 2023-TXT-08: Consideration of amendments to Section 420.010 Land Use Matrix of the Zoning Code related to Outdoor Storage Area of vehicles associated with a dealership that is not located on the same premises.\n\nCommunity Development Director Amy Starck gave a summary of the Staff report to the Commission.
