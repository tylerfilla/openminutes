                at 1235 Park Meadow Drive. The parcel is zoned "R-3" Residential District.

                Director Starck stated that all was in order for the Case to be heard.

                Petitioner, Tony Camacho, approached the Board to present his request. He explained that
                he is proposing to construct a deck that is encroaching the required 30-foot Rear Setback
                and building an addition (enclosed vestibule). He explained that most of his yard is out of
                the flood plain but, that his basement floor is 2 feet lower than the MSD Stormwater runoff.

                The Board questioned the Petitioner to ask if he has a drain down by the back door and he
                responded that he did not. They also asked if he was enclosing the deck which he is not
                doing and what is the landscaping around the house which is all gravel. The Board also
                wanted to put to in the record that no one from the audience wanted to speak about this.

                Chairperson Brandt read the proposed conditions of approval and the Petitioner agreed to
                them all.

                For the record, Community Development Director Amy Starck stated that she had received
                two calls from the public inquiring about the requested variance; however, neither spoke
                in favor or against the request.

                Chairperson Brandt asked for public comment. No person came forward in favor or against
                the   Petition.     Chairperson         Brandt closed           the   public     comment portion             of the      meeting.
                Discussion ensued among the members.

                Member Mooney made a motion to APPROVE, WITH CONDITIONS, CASE 2023-
                V-03. Member Phillips-Pigg seconded the motion.

                Conditions of Approval:

                I.   This Variance from Section 415.0S0(D)(l)(c) of the Zoning Code is solely for a covered deck
                     to encroach the required Rear Setback by approximately ten (10) feet, creating a 20-foot Rear
                     Setback, and for the enclosed entry vestibule to encroach the Rear Setback by approximately
                     nine (9) feet, creating a 21-foot Rear Setback, as indicated on the site plan dated May 19, 2023.
