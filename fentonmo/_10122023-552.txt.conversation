Cruts, Chairman (Wisbrock, Huels, Jokerst)\n\u2022      August 31, 2023, Monthly Financial Report.\n       Alderman Cruts summarized the monthly financial report. There were no questions or comments.\n\n\u2022      Discussion regarding Financial Services Contract.\n       Following competitive bidding for the City's financial                                         services via a           Request for Proposal (RFP) in\n       2013, the City approved an                      agreement with the City's current financial service provider, Sikich, LLP\n       (formerly Hochchild, Bloom & Company, LLP), via Ordinance 3347. Since such time, the City has\n       extended the agreement to                       continue services with Sikich, LLP.                              The most recent extension                      was in\n       October of 2022, via Ordinance 4269.\n\n       As the existing agreement is set to expire on December 31, 2023, an extension to the agreement will\n       need to be approved by the Board of Aldermen to continue services in 2024 . The City's current 2023\n       agreement also approved a monthly fee                                  of $7,550 (for sixteen (16) hours per week); however, the\n       proposed monthly fee for 2024 is $8,000, a $450 monthly increase. It is noted that Tammy Alsop will\n       be performing the services for the City on both days (sixteen (16) hours per week).\n\n       City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner noted that this an additional                                                I-year term contract that expires on\n       December 31, 2024, unless cancelled by either party and noted the City can cancel at any time.\n\n       Alderman Cruts made a motion to forward to the October Board of Aldermen meeting the Financial\n       Services Contract for an additional I-year term at the proposed monthly fee of $8,000 monthly fee. The\n       motion was            seconded         by    Alderman           Wisbrock.         Upon       a   voice vote          being taken,           the    motion        passed\n      unanimously by the Committee.\n\n\u2022     Presentation and request by Infinity Hospitality, LLC for a CID, TDD, and Tax Abatement for the\n       redevelopment of a property located at 800 S.

The motion was\nseconded by Alderman Clauss.                          Upon a voice vote being taken, the motion passed unanimously                                                      by the\nCommittee.\n\nHEALTH AND SAFETY - Aid. Jokerst, Chairman (Cruts, Wisbrock, Clauss)\n\u2022     Consideration of bids for the 2023 Demolition Services.\n      As requested by the Board, the City advertised for bids for the 2023 Demolition Services on August 18,\n      2023. A mandatory pre-bid meeting was held on site at 800 S. Highway Drive (former Stratford Inn) on\n      September 12, 2023, where twenty-two (22) prospective bidders were in attendance. The bid opening\n      was held on September 19, 2023, at 10:00 a.m. and six (6) bids were submitted before the deadline for\n      consideration. The bids for the 2023 Demolition Services for consideration were available for review.\n\n      Spirtas Wrecking Company $326,691 was the lowest bid.\n\n\n                                                                                        2\n                                                                 Board of Aldermen Committee Meeting\n                                                                              October 12, 2023\n\f\nCity Attorney Erin Seele explained the building was declared a dangerous structure after hearing in\nOctober 2022. There have been numerous conversations with the owners to move forward with the\nproperty and the City has tried to be cooperative, but it is a dangerous structure. There was a warrant\nserved to access property for pre-bid walk-through for                                  bids to demo the building before spending\ntaxpayer money. She believes the attorney is here as the property owners have now said they want to\ndemolish the building themselves.                     Does the City allow more time before demolition or move forward\nwith consideration.\n\nLoren       Ettinger,      120    S.   Central       Avenue,       Clayton       MO      was     present      representing        owners       Infinity\nHospitality,        LLC.     He    shared      the owners        have     reviewed       the    City's    demolition        bids    and    they    have\nsecured a contract from                Spirtas Wrecking Company themselves to demolish the building. They are\ncurrently working on whether to demolish the entire building or can it be partially demolished leaving\nfoundation for future building.\n\nAlderman Cruts expressed if partial would be considered it would need to be structurally safe. City\nAdministrator Nikki Finkbiner expressed that permits would be needed from County and County would\ndetermine it request would be structurally safe before issuing permit.\n\nAlderman Wisbrock expressed concerns if partial demolition on                                        how     remaining building would                 be\nsecured for safety and security as the building is                            not secured right now and a safety concern. Mr.\nEttinger responded that he did                    not have       an answer to          how it would           be   secured as they have not\ncompleted the review to determine if anything would remain.\n\nAlderman Wisbrock continued that he understands the fire district will not service that building because\nof its unsafe condition and that the police expend a lot of resources on that building as is, so he has a\nbig concern leaving any of it up.\n\nAlderman Jokerst             inquired      if Infinity      Hospitality would            perform       demolition,        how     long would the\ndemolition take. There has been no maintenance, mowing, painting, etc. to show effort to try to take\ncare of the building or grounds.                   Mr. Ettinger responded that the owners had plans but then covid hit\nand he is not trying to make excuses, but it was impossible to get a loan at that time.                                         Alderman Jokerst\nresponded that she understands that, but they have done nothing to at least make it look like a good\nstructure. Mr. Ettinger responded he wished it was possible to make it look like a decent structure.\n\nCity Attorney Erin Seele shared since Infinity Hospitality has taken over ownership, the building has\nfurther deteriorated. The dangerous structure hearing was a year ago.                                      She stated the hazards are well\nknown including that there has been a fire.\n\nAlderman Jokerst stated she                   is not interested         in   partial demolition.           She feels      the owners are now\nmoving forward with demolition consideration due to the City securing bids and moving forward with\ndemolition        consideration.          She expressed           frustration      with the amount of City resources expended\nbecause the property owners have not taken care of the building.\n\nMr. Ettinger stated the owners are working on design for a new building.\n\nAlderman Maserang stated he is not in favor of partial demolition and believes the demolition needs to\nbe complete.         That building is condemned, and the partial building will still be condemned.\n\nAlderman Clauss inquired on timeline for demolition. Alderman Cruts expressed demolition needs to\noccur quickly and not be drawn out.                     Mr. Ettinger stated Erin told him the City wants timing so it is on\nthe top of his list.\n\n\n                                                                         3\n                                                    Board of Aldennen Committee Meeting\n                                                                October 12, 2023\n\f\nAlderman Bereitschaft expressed he feels Infinity Hospitality request to demolish themselves is a delay\ntactic    and    is not     in favor      of delay.        Mr. Ettinger stated           they have already been working on                       that\nengineering so it will not cause delay.\n\nAlderman Huels asked Community and Development Director Amy Starck what the typical timeline\nwas to obtain demolition permits. Community and Development Director Amy Starck replied typically\nseven to ten (7- I 0) days for permits from the City but she did not know the typical timeline for County\npermits.      It was expressed that the Patels could seek a permit tomorrow.\n\nMayor Maurath thanked Mr.                    Ettinger for attending the meeting, and shared he                           has safety concerns\nregrading a partial demolition and any delay as the building is currently not safe or secure.                                               He has\npersonally seen people walk into that building and stated we have been lucky this far as it is a big safety\nconcern.\n\nMr. Ettinger shared he spoke to the owners fifteen ( 15) minutes prior to this meeting.\n\nPublic Works Director Dan Howard shared it can take weeks before a demolition permit is approved by\nthe County. He further shared the timeline from start to finish would be two - three (2-3) months and\nbefore actual demolition would commence utilities have to be disconnected.\n\nMayor Maurath asked Community and Development Director Amy Starck if there have been multiple\nconversations         with    the   owners       concerning what needs               to   be   done.     Community          and    Development\nDirector Amy Starck replied yes. Mayor Maurath stated for the record she answered yes from her seat.\n\nMr. Ettinger agreed on the safety concerns. The owners were asked to obtain bid from Spirtas, they\nreceived that bid. There has been little communication between him and the owners due to his meetings,\nbut he stated when he gets involved things get done.                                 He stated they         can put together a timeline,\nsubmission for permits, and deadline for completion of the job.\n\nAlderman Wisbrock stated he is done with giving time. He is in favor of forwarding demolition services\nto the October Board of Aldermen meeting for consideration. There is opportunity for discussion at that\nmeeting.\n\nAlderman Maserang inquired if the Spirtas contract with Infinity Hospitality was the same price as the\nquote given to the City. Mr. Ettinger replied yes.\n\nAlderman Jokerst made a motion to forward to the October Board of Aldermen meeting the 2023\nDemolition Services. The motion was seconded by Alderman Wisbrock.\n\nAlderman Wisbrock rescinded his motion. Alderman Jokerst rescinded her motion.\n\nAlderman Jokerst made a motion to forward to the October Board of Aldermen meeting the 2023\nDemolition       Services with         Spirtas     Wrecking Company                for   $326,691.       The motion was seconded                  by\nAlderman Wisbrock.\n\nUpon the roll being called, the Committee voted as follows:\n\n                 Alderman Clauss                     Aye                    Alderman Cruts                      Aye\n                 Alderman Wisbrock                   Aye                    Alderman Jokerst                    Aye\n\nIt was announced that the motion was passed unanimously by the Committee.\n\n\n                                                                       4\n                                                   Board of Aldennen Committee Meeting\n                                                               October 12, 2023\n\f\n          Alderman Wisbrock suggested an agenda item for consideration to demolition service be placed on\n          October meeting prior to consideration of the bill.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n         Alderman Bereitschaft noted for the record the Board of Aldermen meeting is October 26tl                                                                                                                                    starting at\n          7:00         p.m.         and         Infinity            Hospitality,                   LLC           needs           to      submit signed                        contract from                       Spirtas             Wrecking\n         Company for review prior to meeting, with timeline, and proof demo permits have been applied for.\n\nAlderman Huels made a motion to move Parks and Recreation Committee/Tree Advisory Board topics next\non the agenda with the YMCA presentation first.

City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner\n                 expressed staff can inquire on available grants and further noted that the City was considering\n                 replacing the outdoor play structure before the YMCA took over management of the facilities.\n\n                 City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner shared the $400,000 cost for the structure is not a quote but is\n                 an estimate, and to obtain true cost the project will need to go out for bid for options. The YMCA\n                 Board would review bids for best options to present to the Board of Aldermen for consideration.\n\n                                                                                                                            5\n                                                                                           Board of Aldermen Committee Meeting\n                                                                                                              October 12, 2023\n\f\n                   Alderman Wisbrock asked if expense would be paid for by the restricted parks/storm water funds.\n                   City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner replied yes.\n\n                   Mayor Maurath shared discussions regarding the generator occurred earlier this year and he thought\n                   it needed to be reviewed for feasibility. He feels discussions with Ameren UE would be beneficial\n                   for      reasons            for       power           loss       and        power            levels.          City        Administrator Nikki                              Finkbiner               shared           the\n                  generators at City Hall and Public Works building only power a partial part of the buildings when\n                  they are being used.\n\n                  Public Works Director Dan Howard shared when the RiverChase facility was                                                                                                               built there is                 an\n                  agreement with Fabick when power went out during an emergency, they would provide a temporary\n                  generator that would                                power           partial          part of RiverChase,                              the      wiring            is    already            in     place         for       a\n                  temporary solution. Alderman Maserang suggested the agreement with Fabick needs to be reviewed\n                  further to make sure service is still available.\n\n                  Alderman Wisbrock shared there are options for type of generators new, lease, or used. He feels an\n                  audit needs to be done to determine the size of generator needed for disruption of services. Mr.\n                  Verheyen stated that process was completed to obtain the quote from American Electric Data, Inc.,\n                  that       was         available              for      review,            $302,555                covers           disruption               of services                 for      the       entire         facility.\n                  Alderman Jokerst stated she is in favor of a generator but needs to be reassured what is essential\n                  and what is not.\n\n                  Following discussion, Alderman Huels made a motion to go out for bid for outdoor play structure.\n                  The motion was seconded by Alderman Jokerst. Upon a voice vote being taken, the motion passed\n                  unanimously by the Board of Aldermen.\n\n\u2022        Announcements from the Parks and Recreation Committee/free Advisory Board meeting:\n         \u25a0        Discussion                 regarding              Pickle           Ball Courts                 in     Fenton City                   Park was                continued to                   the November\n                  meeting to allow Staff additional time to obtain quotes for two to four (2-4) Pickleball Courts in\n                  Fenton City Park, constructed with standard pickleball court materials and with needed fencing,\n                  nets, etc. for further consideration.\n                                                                                                                                                               th\n           \u25a0      Activities for the Arbor Day Observance on Saturday, October 7                                                                                   were discussed.\n\n\u2022       The Parks and Recreation Committee/free Advisory Board recommended the following:\n         \u2022        Approval of Parks and Recreation Projects for the 2024 Fiscal Year Budget as presented\n                  during the meeting.\n\n                 Alderman Huels inquired if pickle ball courts could be located near Olde Town pavilion. Public\n                  Works Director Dan Howard replied Olde Town is not as much of floodway concern as Fenton City\n                 Park. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner stated she would need to review as land may be deed\n                 restricted as property was purchased with FEMA funds.\n\n                 Alderman Jokerst inquired on landscaping for Heroes Memorial. She feels the landscaping was just\n                 redone at the Memorial by a Boy Scout project; she feels                                                                                landscaping expense would be better\n                 spent in other parks.\n\n                 Alderman Maserang shared he was                                                     not in          favor of the $200,000 expense to install pickle ball\n                 courts. He shared that currently there are 4.8 million pickle ball players in the country compared to\n                 24.4 million soccer players. The Board voted to not move forward with soccer field lighting with a\n                 $336,000 expense for two (2) fields, which he feels would serve more people. On average it would\n                 cost 4.1 cents per player for pickle ball courts vs 1.3 cents per player for soccer lighting. He feels\n                 pickle ball is more a rave, while soccer continues to grow and stays consistent. Alderman Maserang\n                 inquired if grants were available for the project. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner stated she feels\n                discussion would be great topic contained within a Master Plan.\n\n                                                                                                                     6\n                                                                                      Board of Aldennen Committee Meeting\n                                                                                                        October 12, 2023\n\f\n                    Alderman Jokerst stated she disagreed with City Administrator's comment regarding need                                                                                                                                     for a\n                    Master Plan. She further expressed pickle ball serves a different genre of people than soccer but\n                    agrees pickle ball may be a fad.\n\n                    Alderman Huels made a motion to forward to the October Board of Aldermen meeting the Parks\n                    and Recreation Projects for the 2024 Fiscal Year Budget as presented during the meeting. The\n                    motion was seconded by                                         Alderman Clauss.

He did a lot of work\n           around the subdivision himself. He loves his neighborhood and does anything to keep it up and\n           looking good while keeping HOA costs down. He goes above and beyond the call of duty as a\n           trustee.\n\n     \u2022     Vince Lochirco - who dedicates his time creating wooden toys and puzzles in his basement that are\n           donated to Mercy Hospital Children's Unit and Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital for a gift to a\n           child   who    is going through a         rough time.       Vince receives no money or reimbursement for                       the\n           material and supplies needed. His reward is the many smiles that his gifts bring to those children.\n          Those gifts are taken home by each child, so it is a constant job keeping them in stock.\n\n     After discussion, Alderman Cruts made a motion to nominate Vince Lochirco for the 2023 John Fabick\n     Service Award. The motion was seconded by Alderman Bereitschaft. Upon a voice vote being taken, the\n     motion passed unanimously by the Board of Aldermen.\n\nEXECUTIVE SESSION\nAt 8:22 p.m. Alderman Clauss made a motion to enter into Executive Session pursuant to Section 610.021\n( 18) Operational guidelines, policies and specific response plans developed, adopted or maintained by any\npublic agency responsible for law enforcement, public safety, first response, or public health for                                    use in\nresponding to or preventing any critical incident which is or appears to be terrorist in nature and which has\nthe potential to endanger individual or public safety or health.

Cruts, Chairman (Wisbrock, Huels, Jokerst)\n- August 31, 2023, Monthly Financial Report. Alderman Cruts summarized the monthly financial report. There were no questions or comments.\n- Discussion regarding Financial Services Contract. Following competitive bidding for the City's financial services via a Request for Proposal (RFP) in 2013, the City approved an agreement with the City's current financial services provider, Sikich, LLP (formerly Hochschild, Bloom & Company, LLP), via Ordinance 3347. Since such time, the City has extended the agreement to continue services with Sikich, LLP. The most recent extension was in October of 2022, via Ordinance 4269.\n\nAs the existing agreement is set to expire on December 31, 2023, an extension to the agreement will need to be approved by the Board of Aldermen to continue services in 2024. The City's current 2023 agreement also approved a monthly fee of $7,550 (for sixteen (16) hours per week); however, the proposed monthly fee for 2024 is $8,000, a $450 monthly increase. It is noted that Tammy Alsop will be performing the services for the City on both days (sixteen (16) hours per week).\n\nCity Administrator Nikki Finkbiner noted that this an additional 1-year term contract that expires on December 31, 2024, unless cancelled by either party and noted the City can cancel at any time.\n\nAlderman Cruts made a motion to forward to the October Board of Aldermen meeting the Financial Services Contract for an additional 1-year term at the proposed monthly fee of $8,000 monthly fee. The motion was seconded by Alderman Wisbrock. Upon a voice vote being taken, the motion passed unanimously by the Committee.\n\n- Presentation and request by Infinity Hospitality, LLC for a CID, TDD, and Tax Abatement for the redevelopment of a property located at 800 S. Highway Drive. The request was withdrawn.\n\nAlderman Jokerst made a motion to move Health and Safety topics next on the agenda. The motion was seconded by Alderman Clauss. Upon a voice vote being taken, the motion passed unanimously by the Committee.\n\nHEALTH AND SAFETY - Aid. Jokerst, Chairman (Cruts, Wisbrock, Clauss)\n- Consideration of bids for the 2023 Demolition Services. As requested by the Board, the City advertised for bids for the 2023 Demolition Services on August 18, 2023. A mandatory pre-bid meeting was held on site at 800 S. Highway Drive (former Stratford Inn) on September 12, 2023, where twenty-two (22) prospective bidders were in attendance. The bid opening was held on September 19, 2023, at 10:00 a.m. and six (6) bids were submitted before the deadline for consideration. The bids for the 2023 Demolition Services for consideration were available for review.\n\nSpirtas Wrecking Company $326,691 was the lowest bid.\n\nCity Attorney Erin Seele explained the building was declared a dangerous structure after hearing in October 2022. There have been numerous conversations with the owners to move forward with the property and the City has tried to be cooperative, but it is a dangerous structure. There was a warrant served to access property for pre-bid walk-through for bids to demo the building before spending taxpayer money. She believes the attorney is here as the property owners have now said they want to demolish the building themselves. Does the City allow more time before demolition or move forward with consideration.\n\nLoren Ettinger, 120 S. Central Avenue, Clayton MO was present representing owners Infinity Hospitality, LLC. He shared the owners have reviewed the City's demolition bids and they have secured a contract from Spirtas Wrecking Company themselves to demolish the building. They are currently working on whether to demolish the entire building or can it be partially demolished leaving foundation for future building.\n\nAlderman Cruts expressed if partial would be considered it would need to be structurally safe. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner expressed that permits would be needed from County and County would determine it request would be structurally safe before issuing permit.\n\nAlderman Wisbrock expressed concerns if partial demolition on how remaining building would be secured for safety and security as the building is not secured right now and a safety concern. Mr. Ettinger responded that he did not have an answer to how it would be secured as they have not completed the review to determine if anything would remain.\n\nAlderman Wisbrock continued that he understands the fire district will not service that building because of its unsafe condition and that the police expend a lot of resources on that building as is, so he has a big concern leaving any of it up.\n\nAlderman Jokerst inquired if Infinity Hospitality would perform demolition, how long would the demolition take. There has been no maintenance, mowing, painting, etc. to show effort to try to take care of the building or grounds. Mr. Ettinger responded that the owners had plans but then covid hit and he is not trying to make excuses, but it was impossible to get a loan at that time. Alderman Jokerst responded that she understands that, but they have done nothing to at least make it look like a good structure. Mr. Ettinger responded he wished it was possible to make it look like a decent structure.\n\nCity Attorney Erin Seele shared since Infinity Hospitality has taken over ownership, the building has further deteriorated. The dangerous structure hearing was a year ago. She stated the hazards are well known including that there has been a fire.\n\nAlderman Jokerst stated she is not interested in partial demolition. She feels the owners are now moving forward with demolition consideration due to the City securing bids and moving forward with demolition consideration. She expressed frustration with the amount of City resources expended because the property owners have not taken care of the building.\n\nMr. Ettinger stated the owners are working on design for a new building.\n\nAlderman Maserang stated he is not in favor of partial demolition and believes the demolition needs to be complete. That building is condemned, and the partial building will still be condemned.\n\nAlderman Clauss inquired on timeline for demolition. Alderman Cruts expressed demolition needs to occur quickly and not be drawn out. Mr. Ettinger stated Erin told him the City wants timing so it is on the top of his list.\n\nAlderman Bereitschaft expressed he feels Infinity Hospitality request to demolish themselves is a delay tactic and is not in favor of delay. Mr. Ettinger stated they have already been working on that engineering so it will not cause delay.\n\nAlderman Huels asked Community and Development Director Amy Starck what the typical timeline was to obtain demolition permits. Community and Development Director Amy Starck replied typically seven to ten (7-10) days for permits from the City but she did not know the typical timeline for County permits. It was expressed that the Patels could seek a permit tomorrow.\n\nMayor Maurath thanked Mr. Ettinger for attending the meeting, and shared he has safety concerns regarding a partial demolition and any delay as the building is currently not safe or secure. He has personally seen people walk into that building and stated we have been lucky this far as it is a big safety concern.\n\nMr. Ettinger shared he spoke to the owners fifteen (15) minutes prior to this meeting.\n\nPublic Works Director Dan Howard shared it can take weeks before a demolition permit is approved by the County. He further shared the timeline from start to finish would be two - three (2-3) months and before actual demolition would commence utilities have to be disconnected.\n\nMayor Maurath asked Community and Development Director Amy Starck if there have been multiple conversations with the owners concerning what needs to be done. Community and Development Director Amy Starck replied yes. Mayor Maurath stated for the record she answered yes from her seat.\n\nMr. Ettinger agreed on the safety concerns. The owners were asked to obtain a bid from Spirtas, they received that bid. There has been little communication between him and the owners due to his meetings, but he stated when he gets involved things get done. He stated they can put together a timeline, submission for permits, and deadline for completion of the job.\n\nAlderman Wisbrock stated he is done with giving time. He is in favor of forwarding demolition services to the October Board of Aldermen meeting for consideration. There is opportunity for discussion at that meeting.\n\nAlderman Maserang inquired if the Spirtas contract with Infinity Hospitality was the same price as the quote given to the City. Mr. Ettinger replied yes.\n\nAlderman Jokerst made a motion to forward to the October Board of Aldermen meeting the 2023 Demolition Services. The motion was seconded by Alderman Wisbrock.\n\nAlderman Wisbrock rescinded his motion. Alderman Jokerst rescinded her motion.\n\nAlderman Jokerst made a motion to forward to the October Board of Aldermen meeting the 2023 Demolition Services with Spirtas Wrecking Company for $326,691. The motion was seconded by Alderman Wisbrock.\n\nUpon the roll being called, the Committee voted as follows:\n\nAlderman Clauss Aye Alderman Cruts Aye\nAlderman Wisbrock Aye Alderman Jokerst Aye\n\nIt was announced that the motion was passed unanimously by the Committee.\n\nAlderman Wisbrock suggested an agenda item for consideration to demolition service be placed on October meeting prior to consideration of the bill.\n\nAlderman Bereitschaft noted for the record the Board of Aldermen meeting is October 26th starting at 7:00 p.m. and Infinity Hospitality, LLC needs to submit a signed contract from Spirtas Wrecking Company for review prior to meeting, with a timeline, and proof demo permits have been applied for.\n\nAlderman Huels made a motion to move Parks and Recreation Committee/Tree Advisory Board topics next on the agenda with the YMCA presentation first. The motion was seconded by Alderman Clauss. Upon a voice vote being taken, the motion passed unanimously by the Committee.\n\nPARKS AND RECREATION COMMITTEE/TREE ADVISORY BOARD - Aid. Huels, Liaison\nAll recommendations from the Parks and Recreation Committee/Tree Advisory Board will be forwarded to the next Board Meeting for approval unless otherwise noted.\n\nOther Parks and Recreation items:\n- Presentation and consideration of request by the YMCA for 2024 Capital Projects for RiverChase YMCA. Tom Verheyen, RiverChase YMCA Director was in attendance of the meeting via Zoom Videoconference. The proposed YMCA 2024 Capital Projects for RiverChase YMCA were available for review.\n\nAlderman Jokerst inquired on $300,000 generator request. Alderman Wisbrock shared he does see the price tag as high but views the expense of the generator would assist if needed for emergency/disaster backup.\n\nMr. Verheyen shared the YMCA guarantees that for every community they are located in, they provide safe shelters and cooling and warming centers. Their only requirement is that the person has to pass a sexual offender screening for access into the center.\n\nAlderman Huels asked Mr. Verheyen how many of the other YMCA locations have a generator. Mr. Verheyen replied all the rec-plex centers (Carondelet Park, O'Fallon, all facilities over 70,000 square feet) have generators.\n\nAlderman Maserang shared the RiverChase YMCA is a voting site, and he feels if there would be a power outage on election day it would be a benefit to be able to keep the building up and running.\n\nMr. Verheyen shared in discussions with City officials and YMCA properties team, it would be beneficial and serve as a protection for the expensive pool pumps, HVAC system, and other large systems.\n\nAlderman Jokerst inquired on expense for outdoor play structure request. Mr. Verheyen shared the current outdoor play structure is twenty (20) years old, unsafe, features on the structure are broken, and the main infrastructure underneath is rusted and deteriorating. Due to the age of the structure, replacement parts cannot be obtained.\n\nAlderman Maserang inquired if any grants were available. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner expressed staff can inquire about available grants and further noted that the City was considering replacing the outdoor play structure before the YMCA took over management of the facilities.\n\nCity Administrator Nikki Finkbiner shared the $400,000 cost for the structure is not a quote but is an estimate, and to obtain true cost the project will need to go out for bid for options. The YMCA Board would review bids for the best options to present to the Board of Aldermen for consideration.\n\nAlderman Wisbrock asked if the expense would be paid for by the restricted parks/stormwater funds. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner replied yes.\n\nMayor Maurath shared discussions regarding the generator occurred earlier this year and he thought it needed to be reviewed for feasibility. He feels discussions with Ameren UE would be beneficial for reasons for power loss and power levels. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner shared the generators at City Hall and the Public Works building only power a partial part of the buildings when they are being used.\n\nPublic Works Director Dan Howard shared when the RiverChase facility was built there is an agreement with Fabick when power went out during an emergency, they would provide a temporary generator that would power a partial part of RiverChase, the wiring is already in place for a temporary solution. Alderman Maserang suggested the agreement with Fabick needs to be reviewed further to make sure service is still available.\n\nAlderman Wisbrock shared there are options for the type of generators: new, lease, or used. He feels an audit needs to be done to determine the size of the generator needed for disruption of services. Mr. Verheyen stated that process was completed to obtain the quote from American Electric Data, Inc., that was available for review, $302,555 covers disruption of services for the entire facility. Alderman Jokerst stated she is in favor of a generator but needs to be reassured what is essential and what is not.\n\nFollowing the discussion, Alderman Huels made a motion to go out for bid for an outdoor play structure. The motion was seconded by Alderman Jokerst. Upon a voice vote being taken, the motion passed unanimously by the Board of Aldermen.\n\nAnnouncements from the Parks and Recreation Committee/Tree Advisory Board meeting:\n\n- Discussion regarding Pickle Ball Courts in Fenton City Park was continued to the November meeting to allow Staff additional time to obtain quotes for two to four (2-4) Pickleball Courts in Fenton City Park, constructed with standard pickleball court materials and with needed fencing, nets, etc. for further consideration.\n  \n- Activities for the Arbor Day Observance on Saturday, October 7th were discussed.\n\nThe Parks and Recreation Committee/Tree Advisory Board recommended the following:\nApproval of Parks and Recreation Projects for the 2024 Fiscal Year Budget as presented during the meeting.\n\nAlderman Huels inquired if pickleball courts could be located near Olde Town pavilion. Public Works Director Dan Howard replied Olde Town is not as much of a floodway concern as Fenton City Park. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner stated she would need to review as land may be deed restricted as the property was purchased with FEMA funds.\n\nAlderman Jokerst inquired about landscaping for Heroes Memorial. She feels the landscaping was just redone at the Memorial by a Boy Scout project; she feels landscaping expense would be better spent in other parks.\n\nAlderman Maserang shared he was not in favor of the $200,000 expense to install pickleball courts. He shared that currently, there are 4.8 million pickleball players in the country compared to 24.4 million soccer players. The Board voted not to move forward with soccer field lighting with a $336,000 expense for two (2) fields, which he feels would serve more people. On average it would cost 4.1 cents per player for pickleball courts vs 1.3 cents per player for soccer lighting. He feels pickleball is more of a rave, while soccer continues to grow and stays consistent. Alderman Maserang inquired if grants were available for the project. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner stated she feels a discussion would be a great topic contained within a Master Plan.\n\nAlderman Jokerst stated she disagreed with the City Administrator's comment regarding the need for a Master Plan. She further expressed that pickleball serves a different genre of people than soccer but agrees pickleball may be a fad.\n\nAlderman Huels made a motion to forward to the October Board of Aldermen meeting the Parks and Recreation Projects for the 2024 Fiscal Year Budget as presented during the meeting. The motion was seconded by Alderman Clauss. Upon a voice vote being taken, the motion passed unanimously by the Board of Aldermen.\n\nPLANNING AND ZONING COMMISSION REPORT - Aid.
