He mentioned that he              is\n    working with the Petitioners to help them tie into the stormwater system on his property. He stated the\n    proposed plans for the property would be an upgrade and an asset to Fenton.\n\n    OLD BUSINESS: None\n\n\n    NEW BUSINESS:\n\n               A motion was made by Chairperson Yeoman and seconded by Vice-Chairperson Sherrel to move\n               Case 2023-SUP-09 to the front of the agenda. The motion was approved by voice vote .\n                                                                                   ..\n               CASE 2023-SUP-09: A Petition by Shriya Management, LLC for a Special Use Permit to operate a\n               Hotel at 650 South Highway Drive. The property is zoned \"HP-1\" Hospitality Park District.\n\n               Community          Development           Director      Amy      Starck     gave     a summary         of the      Staff report       to   the\n               Commission. A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department.\n               She explained that the Petitioners are proposing to demolish the former Super 8 and build a new\n               Home2 Suites, a Hilton brand, at this location. A hotel will require a Special Use Permit in this\n               district.\n\n              The     Petitioners,      Jiten    &    Shelly     Patel    along    with     Paul    Williams       of Premier        Hotel     Properties\n              Management Service, approached. Mr. Williams explained that Premier Hotel Properties will be\n              managing the property and will provide oversight to ensure the property is being maintained to\n              brand      standards.       He    added      that    while     the    owners      are    ultimately       responsible        for   property\n              maintenance, frequent quality checks are performed by Premier Hotel Properties and Hilton will\n              assess fines if the property is found to be in inferior condition.\n\n              The Petitioner, Jiten Patel stated that Hilton requires that they                                 have    specific portable electric\n              cooktops available to             guests if they request one. The cooktops can only be used in a specific\n              place, are not permanently installed in the room, and won't be available to                                       30% or more of the\n              rooms at one time.             Director Starck noted that, because they will not be permanently installed\n              kitchen facilities and cannot be provided to 30% of the rooms, the proposed use does not meet the\n              definition of an Extended Stay Hotel found in the Zoning Code, and guests would not be allowed\n              to stay more than 30 consecutive days. Director Starck further noted that this was advertised and\n              would be approved as a Hotel for Home2 Suites and anything else would not be allowed and\n              would have to come back to the Commission and Board for consideration.                                          Mr. Patel offered that\n              Hilton does not allow permanent residency on site and confirmed guests would not stay for more\n              than 30 consecutive days. The Commission discussed their concerns about portable electric cook\n              tops. Mayor Maurath asked that Staff look into this a bit more.\n\f\nPlanning and Zoning Commission Meeting                                                                                                  Page3\nMay 2, 2023\n\n                Following discussion, Chairperson Yeoman read aloud the conditions of approval. The Petitioner\n                agreed to all.\n\n                Conditions of Approval:\n                     This Special Use Permit (SUP) is solely for Shriya Management, LLC, to operate a Home2\n                     Suites Hotel as indicated on the site plan submitted by the Petitioner, dated April 3, 2023 with\n                     the following conditions:\n\n                     1.   Evidence that the subject building will be operated under the Home2 Suites franchise must\n                          be    provided       to   the    Community          Development           Director      before     an    Occupancy         Permit\n                          application will be approved.\n                     2.   The     subject building          shall   only    be    utilized    for   a Hotel      (motel)      use,   as   defined      under\n                          Section 400.030 of the Zoning Code. Any modifications to the buildings to allow for any\n                          non-transient use is not approved by this SUP.\n                     3.   The     property       shall     be   maintained         and    kept     in   compliance          with     existing     property\n                          maintenance          and    building      standards       and    will    be   operated       and    maintained,        including\n                          outward       appearances,         as   a   Hotel.     Outdoor       furniture      and    fire   pits/grills     shall    not   be\n                          permitted on the property. The collection of trash/rubbish outside the proper receptacles is\n                          prohibited.\n                     4.   Derelict vehicles and any vehicles which are not associated with the Hotel/motel use are\n                          not permitted to be stored on the property.\n                    5.    Approval of this           Special Use Permit renders all                 previous Special Use Permits null and\n                          void.\n                    6.    Compliance with all other applicable City of Fenton Codes and Ordinances.\n\n               Chairperson          Yeoman         made a motion             to APPROVE              CASE       2023-SUP-09 with the                 six (6)\n               conditions read into the record.

A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department.\n               She explained the Petitioners are proposing a new 4-story hotel at this location after demolition of\n               both existing motel buildings and pool area. The proposed building materials and overall height of\n               the building do not meet the requirements of the \"HP-1\" District; however, alternative building\n               material and building height in excess of 50' can be approved by the Commission under Site Plan\n               Review to maintain brand standards. Director Starck noted that some amendments are needed on\n               the site plan to meet minimum parking space dimensions and paving material requirements. The\n               proposed stormwater management plan will require review and approval by MSD. Director Starck\n               explained that the proposed new development will meet all setback and buffer area requirements,\n               including along lot lines where variances have been granted, and the lot will be landscaped to\n               provide more green space than what is currently on the lot.\n\n               In response        to   questions      from     the   Commission,          Petitioner Vaishali          Patel    explained       that they\n               decided to go with a Hilton brand rather than a Wyndham brand (Super 8 and Baymont), because\n               it is a better brand and because of market conditions.\n\n              Chairperson Yeoman read aloud the conditions of approval. The Petitioners agreed to all.\n\n               Conditions of Approval:\n                    This    approval       is solely     for   the proposed         site   development for           a proposed         Hotel    (Home2\n                    Suites) at 650 S.

The proposed access driveways within MoDOT ROW will need to be reviewed and\n                              approved        by    MoDOT         before      construction.

Commissioner Glover seconded the motion.\n\n9 Ayes; 0 Nays; 1 Absent: Motion APPROVED by voice vote.\n\nPUBLIC COMMENTS: Ron Emmenegger, owner of property at 575 Rudder Road, spoke in favor of the Petitions on the agenda for Shriya Management related to a new hotel. He mentioned that he is working with the Petitioners to help them tie into the stormwater system on his property. He stated the proposed plans for the property would be an upgrade and an asset to Fenton.\n\nOLD BUSINESS: None\n\nNEW BUSINESS:\n\nA motion was made by Chairperson Yeoman and seconded by Vice-Chairperson Sherrel to move Case 2023-SUP-09 to the front of the agenda. The motion was approved by voice vote.\n\nCASE 2023-SUP-09: A Petition by Shriya Management, LLC for a Special Use Permit to operate a Hotel at 650 South Highway Drive. The property is zoned \"HP-1\" Hospitality Park District.\n\nCommunity Development Director Amy Starck gave a summary of the Staff report to the Commission. A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department. She explained that the Petitioners are proposing to demolish the former Super 8 and build a new Home2 Suites, a Hilton brand, at this location. A hotel will require a Special Use Permit in this district.\n\nThe Petitioners, Jiten & Shelly Patel along with Paul Williams of Premier Hotel Properties Management Service, approached. Mr. Williams explained that Premier Hotel Properties will be managing the property and will provide oversight to ensure the property is being maintained to brand standards. He added that while the owners are ultimately responsible for property maintenance, frequent quality checks are performed by Premier Hotel Properties and Hilton will assess fines if the property is found to be in inferior condition.\n\nThe Petitioner, Jiten Patel stated that Hilton requires that they have specific portable electric cooktops available to guests if they request one. The cooktops can only be used in a specific place, are not permanently installed in the room, and won't be available to 30% or more of the rooms at one time. Director Starck noted that, because they will not be permanently installed kitchen facilities and cannot be provided to 30% of the rooms, the proposed use does not meet the definition of an Extended Stay Hotel found in the Zoning Code, and guests would not be allowed to stay more than 30 consecutive days. Director Starck further noted that this was advertised and would be approved as a Hotel for Home2 Suites and anything else would not be allowed and would have to come back to the Commission and Board for consideration. Mr. Patel offered that Hilton does not allow permanent residency on site and confirmed guests would not stay for more than 30 consecutive days. The Commission discussed their concerns about portable electric cooktops. Mayor Maurath asked that Staff look into this a bit more.\n\nFollowing discussion, Chairperson Yeoman read aloud the conditions of approval. The Petitioner agreed to all.\n\nConditions of Approval:\nThis Special Use Permit (SUP) is solely for Shriya Management, LLC, to operate a Home2 Suites Hotel as indicated on the site plan submitted by the Petitioner, dated April 3, 2023 with the following conditions:\n\n1. Evidence that the subject building will be operated under the Home2 Suites franchise must be provided to the Community Development Director before an Occupancy Permit application will be approved.\n2. The subject building shall only be utilized for a Hotel (motel) use, as defined under Section 400.030 of the Zoning Code. Any modifications to the buildings to allow for any non-transient use is not approved by this SUP.\n3. The property shall be maintained and kept in compliance with existing property maintenance and building standards and will be operated and maintained, including outward appearances, as a Hotel. Outdoor furniture and fire pits/grills shall not be permitted on the property. The collection of trash/rubbish outside the proper receptacles is prohibited.\n4. Derelict vehicles and any vehicles which are not associated with the Hotel/motel use are not permitted to be stored on the property.\n5. Approval of this Special Use Permit renders all previous Special Use Permits null and void.\n6. Compliance with all other applicable City of Fenton Codes and Ordinances.\n\nChairperson Yeoman made a motion to APPROVE CASE 2023-SUP-09 with the six (6) conditions read into the record. Alderman Harrell seconded the motion.\n\nRoll Call:\nChairperson Callan Yeoman Aye\nVice-Chairperson Kevin Sherrel Aye\nSecretary Deborah Abbott Aye\nCommissioner Bill Voorhees Aye\nCommissioner Warren Wisbrock Nay\nCommissioner Bill Glover Aye\nCommissioner Linda Nelson Aye\nCommissioner John Bielicki Absent\nAlderman Ron Harrell Aye\nMayor Joe Maurath Aye\n\n8 Ayes; 1 Nays; 1 Absent: Motion APPROVED\n\nCASE 2023-SPR-03: A Petition by Shriya Management, LLC for Site Plan Review of a proposed Hotel (Home2 Suites) at 650 South Highway Drive. The property is zoned \"HP-1\" Hospitality Park District.\n\nChairperson Yeoman confirmed with the City Attorney that the SUP petition looks to see if the proposed use is appropriate for the location and now this Site Plan Review is to evaluate how the use fits the site.\n\nCommunity Development Director Amy Starck gave a summary of the Staff report to the Commission. A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department. She explained the Petitioners are proposing a new 4-story hotel at this location after demolition of both existing motel buildings and pool area. The proposed building materials and overall height of the building do not meet the requirements of the \"HP-1\" District; however, alternative building material and building height in excess of 50' can be approved by the Commission under Site Plan Review to maintain brand standards. Director Starck noted that some amendments are needed on the site plan to meet minimum parking space dimensions and paving material requirements. The proposed stormwater management plan will require review and approval by MSD. Director Starck explained that the proposed new development will meet all setback and buffer area requirements, including along lot lines where variances have been granted, and the lot will be landscaped to provide more green space than what is currently on the lot.\n\nIn response to questions from the Commission, Petitioner Vaishali Patel explained that they decided to go with a Hilton brand rather than a Wyndham brand (Super 8 and Baymont), because it is a better brand and because of market conditions.\n\nChairperson Yeoman read aloud the conditions of approval. The Petitioners agreed to all.\n\nConditions of Approval:\nThis approval is solely for the proposed site development for a proposed Hotel (Home2 Suites) at 650 S. Highway Drive, as indicated on the plans submitted by the Petitioner dated April 3, 2023, with the following conditions:\n1. The Site Plan shall be amended to:\na. Indicate the minimum Parking and Accessible Space dimensions per Section 430.030 and 430.140 of the Zoning Code.\nb. Indicate details regarding the dumpster enclosure materials in accordance with Section 425.210(8)(4) of the Zoning Code and dumpster pad pavement materials in accordance with Section 430.130(8)(4) of the Zoning Code.\nc. Indicate pavement details for the parking area minimally in accordance with 430.080(A) of the Zoning Code.\n2. The building height in excess of 50 feet is approved as allowed under Section 415.190(F).\n3. The proposed building materials indicated on the Elevation Plans are approved to maintain the prototypical design for market identity, as allowed under Section 415.190(F)(3)(c) of the Zoning Code.\n4. The proposed access driveways within MoDOT ROW will need to be reviewed and approved by MoDOT before construction. Evidence of such approval must be provided to the Director.\n5. Minimally, separate Building, Sign, and Major Land Disturbance Permits will be required. Evidence of MSD approval will be required before a Land Disturbance Permit is released.\n6. Review by the Fenton Fire Protection District (FFPD) may be required. Any needed changes to the submitted plans to meet the FFPD's Code may be administratively approved by the Community Development Director.\n7. Compliance with all other applicable City of Fenton Codes and Ordinances.\n\nChairperson Yeoman made a motion to APPROVE CASE 2023-SPR-03 with the seven (7) conditions read into the record. Commissioner Voorhees seconded the motion.\n\nRoll Call:\nChairperson Callan Yeoman Aye\nVice-Chairperson Kevin Sherrel Aye\nSecretary Deborah Abbott Aye\nCommissioner Bill Voorhees Aye\nCommissioner Warren Wisbrock Aye\nCommissioner Bill Glover Aye\nCommissioner Linda Nelson Aye\nCommissioner John Bielicki Absent\nAlderman Ron Harrell Aye\nMayor Joe Maurath Aye\n\n9 Ayes; 0 Nays; 1 Absent: Motion APPROVED\n\nCASE 2023-TXT-04: Consideration of amendments to the Zoning Code related to Tobacco Shops.\n\nCommunity Development Director Amy Starck explained that staff has received an increase in Occupancies and inquiries for establishments selling tobacco and vape products. Since these products can only be purchased by people 21 or older, similar to alcohol sales, Staff requested the Commission consider adding Tobacco Shops as a Use Allowed by Special Use Permit in those same districts where Liquor Stores may be located under a SUP.
