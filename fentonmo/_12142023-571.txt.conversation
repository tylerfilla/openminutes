Johnson of\n            BestBox Storage Fenton, LLC for Site Plan Review of alternative exterior building material\n            for a    proposed       Self-Storage Facility at 74 7             Gravois Road.          The property         is zoned     \"C-1\"\n            Commercial District.\n\n            Garen Miller, Senior Project Architect for the Petitioner, shared he spoke with the senior\n            partners regarding the recommendation to consider alternative exterior building material as\n            discussed at meetings; the partners said no to the recommendation based on branding and\n            accessibility.       MSD       required double the amount of water retention than expected, which\n            restricted the site and what Best Box does best is provide ample space around the site, so he is\n            asking to stick with the corporate design.\n\n            Alderman Jokerst inquired if approved if it would set a precedent. City Attorney Erin Seele\n            shared it is in the City Code that an exception may be authorized that allows exterior finishes\n            that do not meet City Code if deemed prototypical for corporate or market identity.\n\n            Alderman Harrell suggested Petitioner submit better pictures and sample materials of proposal\n            for further review and asked if there was something completed, he could look at to see what\n            this proposal will really look like. Mr. Miller shared as the company was formed in 2020, to\n            date there are no completed projects in the area.                         He noted Wentzville location is almost\n            complete, but it has a completely different look because it is single-story.                                  He can provide\n            additional information, but they feel it will delay the project and feel the material is adequate\n            for their corporate design and discussed color schemes.\n\n            Mayor Maurath voiced he feels the colors proposed are acceptable but is unsure of proposed\n            exterior building materials. It is difficult to determine corporate identity as nothing has been\n            completed for identity. The challenges regarding Metropolitan Sewer District (MSD) are not\n            part of the consideration of the building materials. The surrounding buildings are masonry and\n            feels the City should uphold to get the best product.\n\n           Alderman        Harrell made          a   motion     to continue Case 2023-SPR-04 with conditions to the\n           January Board of Aldermen Committee meeting to allow Petitioner time to submit samples and\n           pictures. The motion was seconded by Alderman Wisbrock. Upon a vote being taken, it was\n           announced that the motion was passed unanimously by the Board of Aldermen.\n\n      \u2022    Approval, with conditions, of CASE 2023-SP-03: A Petition by Kind Goods Fenton, LLC for\n           a Sign Plan for proposed Wall Signs at 180 Gravois Bluffs Circle, Suite B. The property is\n           zoned \"C-1\" Commercial District.\n\n           Alderman Harrell made a motion to approve Case 2023-SP-034 with conditions. The motion\n           was seconded by Alderman Cruts. Upon a vote being taken, it was announced that the motion\n           was passed unanimously by the Board of Aldermen.\n\n\u2756 Other items from the Community Development Department:\n     There were no other items for discussion.\n\nPARKS        AND       RECREATION               COMMITTEE/fREE ADVISORY BOARD REPORT - Aid.\nHuels, Liaison\n\u2756 Announcements:\n     \u2022     Due to a conflict with holidays, the January and September Committee Meetings will be held\n           Wednesday, January 3, 2024, and Wednesday, September 4, 2024.\n\n                                                                    3\n                                                      Board of Aldermen Meeting\n                                                           December 14, 2023\n\f\n           \u2022        Staff provided an update to the Committee regarding on-going grant projects in City Parks.\n                                                                                                                              11\n           \u2022         The Committee selected Saturday, April 20'                                                                   to observe Arbor Day in 2024.\n\n\u2756 The Parks and Recreation Committee/Tree Advisory Board recommended the following:\n          There were no items for discussion.\n\n\u2756 Other items from the Parks and Recreation Department:\n                    Ord. authorizing the Mayor to execute an agreement with St. Louis Scott Gallagher, LLC\n                    for coaching and instruction for the 2024 City of Fenton Youth Soccer Program.\n\n                    Alderman Huels announced this will be considered under the new bill section.\n\n          \u2022         Ord. authorizing the Mayor to execute an agreement with R.V.

Johnson of Best Box Storage Fenton, LLC for Site Plan Review of alternative exterior building material for a proposed Self-Storage Facility at 747 Gravois Road. The property is zoned \"C-1\" Commercial District.\n\nGaren Miller, Senior Project Architect for the Petitioner, shared he spoke with the senior partners regarding the recommendation to consider alternative exterior building material as discussed at meetings; the partners said no to the recommendation based on branding and accessibility. MSD required double the amount of water retention than expected, which restricted the site and what Best Box does best is provide ample space around the site, so he is asking to stick with the corporate design.\n\nAlderman Jokerst inquired if approved if it would set a precedent. City Attorney Erin Seele shared it is in the City Code that an exception may be authorized that allows exterior finishes that do not meet City Code if deemed prototypical for corporate or market identity.\n\nAlderman Harrell suggested Petitioner submit better pictures and sample materials of the proposal for further review and asked if there was something completed, he could look at to see what this proposal will really look like. Mr. Miller shared as the company was formed in 2020, to date there are no completed projects in the area. He noted Wentzville location is almost complete, but it has a completely different look because it is single-story. He can provide additional information, but they feel it will delay the project and feel the material is adequate for their corporate design and discussed color schemes.\n\nMayor Maurath voiced he feels the colors proposed are acceptable but is unsure of proposed exterior building materials. It is difficult to determine corporate identity as nothing has been completed for identity. The challenges regarding Metropolitan Sewer District (MSD) are not part of the consideration of the building materials. The surrounding buildings are masonry and feel the City should uphold to get the best product.\n\nAlderman Harrell made a motion to continue Case 2023-SPR-04 with conditions to the January Board of Aldermen Committee meeting to allow Petitioner time to submit samples and pictures. The motion was seconded by Alderman Wisbrock. Upon a vote being taken, it was announced that the motion was passed unanimously by the Board of Aldermen.\n\n  - Approval, with conditions, of CASE 2023-SP-03: A Petition by Kind Goods Fenton, LLC for a Sign Plan for proposed Wall Signs at 180 Gravois Bluffs Circle, Suite B.
