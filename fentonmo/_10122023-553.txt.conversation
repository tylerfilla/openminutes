Finkbiner\nCity Clerk Jane Hungler\nPublic Works Director Dan Howard via Zoom Videoconference\nSt. Louis County Police Captain Kevin Lawson\n\nMayor Maurath stated that he called this Special Meeting for:\n\u2022   Discussion regarding         a cost share agreement with the Missouri Department of Conservation\n    (MDC) for a street tree and park tree inventory and an agreement with Davey Resource Group,\n    Inc. to conduct the inventory.\n    As approved by the Board in June of 2023, Staff applied for funding through the MDC Community\n    Forestry Cost Share Program to perform a Street Tree and Park Tree Inventory. Per MDC, a quote from\n    a professional urban tree inventory contractor to perform the service was required to be submitted with\n    the application. MDC also suggested that the City cap the request for funding at $25,000.\n\n    In order to     obtain   the required    quote,   Staff solicited   quotes    from   four (4)   urban   tree inventory\n    contractors from a list of contractors serving the area, as provided by MDC. These contractors were\n    selected by Staff as they are also able to        provide a GIS/GPS database from           the survey for the City's\n    future use.\n\n    One   (1) contractor,    Skip Kincaid     (Hansens),   who    performed the     City's 2007    Street Tree    Inventory\n    declined to quote stating the project \"isn't really in our wheelhouse\" right now.                 The other three (3)\n    contractors, Davey Resource Group, Plan-It Geo, and ArborPro submitted quotes, as follows:\n\n    Cost per Tree:\n         Plan It Geo - $5.00/tree for 3,200 trees. Per the City's calculation of the 2007 Street Tree Inventory\n         and 2008 Park Tree Inventory, the City has approximately 4,500 public trees to be surveyed. Staff\n         reached out to Plan It Geo for a revised estimate and they stated the cost of $5/per tree remains the\n         same up to 10,000 trees. Per this information, the total cost for up to 4,500 trees is $22,500 without\n        any additional add-ons.\n\n                                               Board of Aldennen Special Meeting\n                                                      October 12, 2023\n\f\n                         Davey Resource Group - $4.49/per tree up to 4,500 trees ($20,200), plus $4.50 for any additional\n                         trees, plus a Management Plan for $4,000. The Management Plan includes a list of high priority\n                                                                     st\n                         trees for the 1                                  year and a 5-year tree management plan. The total cost for 4,500 trees with a\n                         Management Plan is $24,200. It is noted that Davey Resource Group performed the City's 2008\n                         Park Tree Inventory Plan and they are a local (St. Louis) company.\n\n                         ArborPro - $5.45/per tree up to 4,500 trees ($24,525), plus a Management Plan for $3,500 - $5,700\n                        - depending on the tier selected. The Management Plan includes a Community Outreach, Strategic\n                         Planning, Budget and Work Plans, review of City Tree Ordinances, Storm Response Plans, etc.,\n                         based on the level of Management Plan selected. The base cost for 4,500 trees is $24,525 without a\n                         Management Plan.\n\n             GIS Data:\n                         All contractors provide GIS/GPS Data that can be utilized in the City's existing GIS System.\n\n             Based on the above information, Staff submitted the quote from Davey Resource Group to apply for\n             funding through MDC.\n\n            On July 31, 2023, Staff was informed that the City was selected to receive funding through the MDC\n            Community                              Forestry                   Cost Share                           Program                      to       perform                    a      Street Tree                          and           Park             Tree             Inventory.                       In\n             discussion                       with           MDC,                  it was               noted              that the                  City           could               utilize the City's                                   Tree            Services Contractor\n            (Gateway Tree) to perform stump removal of public trees for the City's in-kind match - and that the\n            City was also eligible to receive a 75% match (in lieu of 50%) as we are restoring the City's Tree City\n            USA status. Based on this information, the awarded funds from MDC will be $24,200 (the grant max is\n            $25,000), which will cover the cost of the inventory, and the City's match can be $9,900 (more than\n            needed for the match) paid to Gateway Tree to remove 146 stumps in the City's rights of way (ROW).\n            These services through Gateway were already scheduled/budgeted for removal under the City's existing\n            Tree Services Contract with Gateway Tree.\n\n            It is further noted that the City's Bidding and Procurement requirements state that any product/service\n            over $15,000 require formal bidding, unless waived by the Board of Aldermen. As this process takes\n            approximately 30-45 days to complete and time is of the essence once the grant is awarded, Staff is\n            requesting that the Board waive the formal bidding requirements to select Davey Resource Group to\n            perform the City Tree Inventory at a cost of $24,200.\n\n            Mayor Maurath asked what areas would be covered and what services it includes. City Administrator\n           Nikki Finkbiner replied City parks and City rights of way, and noted that heavily wood areas are not\n            included in the plan. This service would create a tree inventory database of dying, diseased and invasive\n                                                                                                                                                   nd                        rd\n            trees,            a study for                         tree         replacement,                            and          1\u2022t,       2       ,    and          3         level            priority                plan of removal                                    for        budgeting\n            purposes.\n\n\u2022           Consideration                                  of Bill                 23-87:                  An           Ordinance                           authorizing                             the          Mayor                    to        execute                    a      cost           share\n           agreement                            with              the          Missouri                       Department                               of Conservation                                        for          a       street tree                          and             park              tree\n           inventory and an agreement with Davey Resource Group, Inc. to conduct the inventory.\n           Sponsor: Huels\n\n           Alderman Huels desired first reading of Bill No. 23-87.

Finkbiner\nCity Clerk Jane Hungler\nPublic Works Director Dan Howard via Zoom Videoconference\nSt. Louis County Police Captain Kevin Lawson\n\nMayor Maurath stated that he called this Special Meeting for:\n\u2022 Discussion regarding a cost-share agreement with the Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC) for a street tree and park tree inventory and an agreement with Davey Resource Group, Inc. to conduct the inventory. As approved by the Board in June of 2023, Staff applied for funding through the MDC Community Forestry Cost Share Program to perform a Street Tree and Park Tree Inventory. Per MDC, a quote from a professional urban tree inventory contractor to perform the service was required to be submitted with the application. MDC also suggested that the City cap the request for funding at $25,000.\n\nIn order to obtain the required quote, Staff solicited quotes from four (4) urban tree inventory contractors from a list of contractors serving the area, as provided by MDC. These contractors were selected by Staff as they are also able to provide a GIS/GPS database from the survey for the City's future use.\n\nOne (1) contractor, Skip Kincaid (Hansens), who performed the City's 2007 Street Tree Inventory declined to quote stating the project \"isn't really in our wheelhouse\" right now. The other three (3) contractors, Davey Resource Group, Plan-It Geo, and ArborPro submitted quotes, as follows:\n\nCost per Tree:\nPlan It Geo - $5.00/tree for 3,200 trees. Per the City's calculation of the 2007 Street Tree Inventory and 2008 Park Tree Inventory, the City has approximately 4,500 public trees to be surveyed. Staff reached out to Plan It Geo for a revised estimate and they stated the cost of $5/per tree remains the same up to 10,000 trees. Per this information, the total cost for up to 4,500 trees is $22,500 without any additional add-ons.\n\nDavey Resource Group - $4.49/per tree up to 4,500 trees ($20,200), plus $4.50 for any additional trees, plus a Management Plan for $4,000. The Management Plan includes a list of high priority trees for the 1st year and a 5-year tree management plan. The total cost for 4,500 trees with a Management Plan is $24,200. It is noted that Davey Resource Group performed the City's 2008 Park Tree Inventory Plan, and they are a local (St. Louis) company.\n\nArborPro - $5.45/per tree up to 4,500 trees ($24,525), plus a Management Plan for $3,500 - $5,700 - depending on the tier selected. The Management Plan includes Community Outreach, Strategic Planning, Budget and Work Plans, review of City Tree Ordinances, Storm Response Plans, etc., based on the level of Management Plan selected. The base cost for 4,500 trees is $24,525 without a Management Plan.\n\nGIS Data:\nAll contractors provide GIS/GPS Data that can be utilized in the City's existing GIS System.\n\nBased on the above information, Staff submitted the quote from Davey Resource Group to apply for funding through MDC.\n\nOn July 31, 2023, Staff was informed that the City was selected to receive funding through the MDC Community Forestry Cost Share Program to perform a Street Tree and Park Tree Inventory. In discussion with MDC, it was noted that the City could utilize the City's Tree Services Contractor (Gateway Tree) to perform stump removal of public trees for the City's in-kind match - and that the City was also eligible to receive a 75% match (in lieu of 50%) as we are restoring the City's Tree City USA status. Based on this information, the awarded funds from MDC will be $24,200 (the grant max is $25,000), which will cover the cost of the inventory, and the City's match can be $9,900 (more than needed for the match) paid to Gateway Tree to remove 146 stumps in the City's rights of way (ROW). These services through Gateway were already scheduled/budgeted for removal under the City's existing Tree Services Contract with Gateway Tree.\n\nIt is further noted that the City's Bidding and Procurement requirements state that any product/service over $15,000 require formal bidding, unless waived by the Board of Aldermen.
