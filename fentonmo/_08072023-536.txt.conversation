The\n     estimate was $100,000 to $150,000 (one surface area/two (2) coutts).\n\n     Public Works Director Dan Howard suggested if considered, a location to be constructed could be the\n     area where the horseshoe pits are currently located in Fenton City Park. There are nearby amenaties\n     such as water fountain and electrical connection if lighting is desired. He further suggested concrete\n     courts due to flooding concerns for longevity and maintenance.\n\n     Phillip Van Cleave inquired            if usage of courts would be free or would there be rental fee.                       Mary\n     Heinemann shared after research most courts are free/first come first serve. Public Works Director\n     Dan Howard shared that unless courts were fenced and locked, rental would be difficult to enforce.\n\n     After discussion, Mary Heinemann made a motion for the Public Works Director explore costs for\n     Pickleball Courts in       Fenton City Park (constructed of concrete in the area where the horseshoe pits\n     are   currently    located)    with    stripping    and   option    for   fencing    and   bring    back    to the    Parks   and\n     Recreation Committee for futther review.

The goal is to have uniform                        informational signage in each\n     park that, as requested by the Parks and Recreation Committee, is more concise (less cluttered) more\n     visible at night (reflective) and ensures the park hours are readily visible.\n\n     Based on the above, staff provided proposed verbiage for each sign that was available for review. The\n     intent is to have the name of the park and the hours of operation (and speed limits, if any) the most\n     visible   information, while providing the basic rules                 within    the park (that are not already           posted\n     elsewhere in the park). The replacement signs could be metal, similar to Valiant and Riverside, with\n     reflective material, at approximately the same size as the existing signs ( 48\" x 36\"). Most likely all\n     signposts will also need to be replaced. Funding for new informational signage in the parks is in the\n     2023 Capital Improvement Plan.\n\n     If the Committee agrees with the verbiage proposal, staff will have a sign company assist in creating\n     the overall design and provide an estimate for the replacements.\n\n     Mike Abbott suggested replacing Fabick Park map sign also.                          City Administrator Nikki          Finkbiner\n     asked Committee members to take an inventory/survey of the signs in their assigned parks to assist\n     staff.\n\n     After discussion, Phillip Van Cleave made a motion approve new informational signs in City Parks,\n     containing the information (signs to be in a similar design as the informational sign in Fabick Nature\n     Preserve, be constructed of a heavier, reflective metal material, at an approximate cost of $185 per\n     sign with a total of nine (9) signs). Mary Heinemann seconded the motion.\n\n          5 Ayes; 0 Nays, 2 Absent, 0 Abstain:              Motion APPROVED by voice vote.\n\n\u2022    Discussion regarding invasive species control in Fabick Nature Preserve\n     As recommended           by the Committee and approved by the Board, staff has begun                           the application\n     process for invasive species removal in the Fabick Nature Preserve under the Missouri Depa1tment of\n     Conservation (MDC) Community Conservation Assistance Program.\n\n                                                                   2\n                                                Parks and Recreation Committee Meeting\n                                                             August 7, 2023\n\f\n      As a reminder, the application for the grant is revolving throughout the year (no deadline); however,\n      the maximum funding available per project is $49,000, with the City providing a minimum 50% cost-\n     share. In order to apply for the grant, the City must have a cost estimate for the overall scope of work\n      to be completed.\n\n      Based on the above, staff met with a certified arborist/contractor (Native Landscape Solutions) that\n      has worked on such projects with the MDC and can assist in developing a plan that will assist in the\n      cost estimate.     It was noted during the site visit that the overall scope of the project will most likely\n     require the City to phase the project out over a few years, which will require the City to apply for\n     multiple grant rounds through the MDC.\n\n      In order for the contractor to provide a cost estimate, the City will need to determine priority areas\n     within the park and the method in which removal will be implemented. A plan that was provided by\n     the contractor for review, consideration, and discussion was available for review.\n\n     After discussion, Mike Abbott made a motion to approve for Staff to apply for the MDC Community\n     Conservation       Assistance Program funds for the Fabick Nature Preserve utilizing                         invasive species\n     removal/native habitat plan presented by Staff with the priority being invasive species control.
