                  Community Development Director Amy Starck gave a presentation and provided a draft of the
                  proposed         changes         to    the     Comprehensive              Plan      for     discussion.         A    copy       of the       PowerPoint
                  presentation is           attached for         the record and copies of corresponding documents provided to the
                  Commission are on file with the Community Development Department.

                  Director Starck explained that Staff is proposing a change to the fom1at                                                   of the Comprehensive
                  Plan, away from the current version designed as a road map as it is difficult to reproduce, to a
                  more      customary           docmnent          format.       Additionally,           Staff has        proposed         an    Introduction           section
                  divided into an Overview, detailing relevant history and demographics of the City, and Purpose,
                  providing overall objectives of the Plan and presenting the six Planning Areas as discussed at the
                  November 2022 Workshop.

                  Discussion ensued regarding the first three Planning Areas - Public and Governmental, Parks and
                 Recreation,           and    Residential.          Director       Starck       described        how      the    draft     of each Planning               Area
                  included an Overview, Goals, and Objectives adding that Staff was careful to uphold the original
                  intent and directives of the 1997 Comprehensive Plan while amending those parts that no longer
                  serve the City. Noted changes from the 1997 Plan are detailed in the footnote to each Planning
                 Area.      She added that a map was also provided for each Planning Area with attention to                                                              those
                 areas where future rezoning may be considered.

                 Additional discussion was held regarding the importance of environmentally sensitive areas and
                 the City's desire to protect those areas through floodplain regulations and other flood mitigation
                 measures, preservation of wooded areas,                                and the        encouragement of large-lot developments or
                 Planned Unit Developments in residential areas.                                    She noted that these environmentally sensitive
                 areas are generally characterized by steep slopes; watershed, drainage courses, floodplains and
                 other water features; shallow soils; wooded areas; and wildlife habitats. Maps were prepared and
                 provided to the Commission related to these topics for discussion.                                               Mayor Maurath noted for the
                 records that around a 1/3 of the City's parks are in floodplain.

                 Following discussion, Chairperson Yeoman called an additional workshop session at 6:00 p.m. in
                 advance of the April 5, 2023 meeting to discuss amendments to the remaining Planning Areas of
                 the Comprehensive Plan.

     ADJOURNMENT:                        7:03 p.m.

                 A motion to adjourn was made by Chairperson Yeoman and seconded by Commissioner Glover
                 The motion was unanimously approved by voice vote.
