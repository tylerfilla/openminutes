Mayor Maurath stated that this meeting was called to continue discussion from the November 9                                                                                                                                         Budget
Hearing.

DISCUSSION OF 2024 BUDGET
Alderman Cruts shared the main discussion is for wage increase consideration. He shared that Public
Works Director Dan Howard had proposed a starting wage of $20.00 per hour for new hires                                                                                                                                              for the
Maintenance                      Worker               I    positions               and         all     current             eligible             Public            Works             Maintenance                      III,       II,     and        I
employees receive a $2.00 per hour increase to their current wage.

Alderman Cruts shared he, Mayor Maurath, Personnel Chair Alderman Huels, Public Works Director Dan
Howard, and City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner met earlier in the week for further discussion of pay
adjustments. There is an additional option proposal for consideration for pay adjustments for the Public
Works Department as discussed at the Personnel Committee Meeting in April 2023: a starting wage of
$19.08 per hour for new hires for the Maintenance Worker I positions and all current eligible Public
Works Maintenance III, ll, and I employees receive a $1.00 per hour increase to their current wage.



                                                                                                             Budget Hearing
                                                                                                         November 16, 2023

Further consideration and discussion ensued regarding all current eligible employees to receive a four
percent (4%) increase and override salary cap to any employee that would be over the maximum pay
grade to receive the full four percent (4%) increase for 2024.

Alderman Cruts inquired on the Board's consideration of a flat amount per employee increase instead of a
four percent ( 4%) increase. The amount of a four percent ( 4%) increase would be $50,228 divided among
the twenty-three (23) eligible employees for a flat amount increase of $2, 184.00/$1.05                             per hour per
eligible employee. He feels the flat amount increase gives a                      larger increase to the       lower pay grade
employees.

Mayor Maurath shared there are other employees in other departments within the City that would                                   be
reaching the maximum salary cap in their pay grade not just in Public Works Department that will also
need to be considered.

Alderman Huels clarified the $1.00 per hour increase to their current wage would only be for current
eligible Public Works Maintenance III, II, and I.

Alderman Wisbrock inquired if the City was running a deficit or surplus in the budget this year and if so,
what is the amount. Alderman Cruts replied there is a surplus. Financial Consultant Tammy Alsop shared
there is a $140,000 surplus in the General Funds budget with original proposal of the starting wage of
$20.00 per hour for new hires for the Maintenance Worker I positions and $2.00 per hour increase for
eligible Public Works employees.

Financial Consultant Tammy Alsop further overviewed the amended proposal of starting wage of $19 .08
per hour for new hires for the Maintenance Worker I positions and $1.00 per hour increase for eligible
Public Works employees and further noted the proposal included reducing Public Works Maintenance
Workers staff from fifteen (15) to twelve (12) positions and further moving two (2) Maintenance Worker
II positions to Maintenance Worker I positions. This amendment is a reduction of salary of approximately
$27,800 changing the surplus in General Funds to $167,000.

Financial Consultant Tammy Alsop shared she forecasted $22,000 per month for Prop U revenue in the
budget conservatively, she noted the amount received in September was $50,000.

Alderman      Bereitschaft     inquired    on   consideration     of leaving      the maximum         salary   cap   in place    or
eliminating cap. Alderman Cruts suggested removing maximum salary cap for 2024 budget year.

Mayor Maurath shared he feels over the years employees top out and the salary ranges are moved. He
asked why have a cap? He feels the cap should be eliminated.

Alderman Wisbrock suggested topics be voted on separately. There were no objections.

Alderman Cruts made a motion for starting pay for Maintenance Worker I to be increased from $15.08 to
$19.08 per hour. The motion was seconded by Alderman Bereitschaft.

Alderman Wisbrock clarified this did not change salary ranges. Mayor Maurath stated for the record the new
hire starting wage of$19.08 is for Maintenance Worker I positions only not salary ranges.

Alderman Clauss inquired why salary ranges were not being changed. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner
expressed if the Board desires a motion can be made for salary ranges to be amended.

Mayor Maurath shared overriding the starting wage to $19.08 and not the salary range gives the Director the
ability to hire an employee with no experience at the base pay of $15.08. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner
shared job postings state starting pay depends on qualifications.

Alderman Huels voiced she feels salary ranges need to be adjusted as the override starting pay is                     in the
middle of the range and in just a few years the employee would obtain the maximum cap of the range.
Alderman Clauss shared she feels salary ranges need to be amended and should be done periodically to stay
competitive and current with cost ofliving.

Alderman Wisbrock expressed if maximum salary cap is eliminated, the range would be base pay to infinity.
Mayor Maurath shared he feels it is ridiculous when an employee caps out that the range is changed.

City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner suggested for purpose of discussion for the 2024 budget, the focus is on
consideration on the override of new hire starting pay increase for Maintenance Worker I to $19.08 and
addressing issue of salary caps being maxed out that would restrict an eligible employee from the ability to
receive their full increase of pay. Discussion of salary ranges can be brought back for a future agenda.

Aldennan Cruts inquired on discussion for consideration of four percent (4%) increase or flat amount
increase of $2, 184.00/$1.05 per hour per eligible employee.

Aldennan Wisbrock stated he believes flat amount rewards the lower pay grades and punishes the higher
pay grades. Mayor Maurath feels flat amount gives more to the lower grades and percentages gives more
to higher levels. He feels it is more equitable for a flat amount. Aldennan Wisbrock voiced he feels flat
amount does not reward higher level employees for the work they perform.

Alderman Cruts inquired if different pay grades could be given different flat amount rates for increases.
City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner replied yes.

Alderman Clauss stated she feels the employees in the higher pay grades have a higher responsibility and
skill levels needed and should be compensated for such.

After discussion, Alderman Wisbrock made a motion that all current eligible employees receive a four
percent (4%) increase. The motion was seconded by Aldennan Clauss.

Upon the roll being called, the Board of Aldennen voted as follows:
