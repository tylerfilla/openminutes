     NEW BUSINESS:

                CASE 2023-TXT-06: A Petition by D-Bat Academics to amend Section 420.010 Land Use
               Matrix of the Zoning Code to allow Indoor Limited Recreational Facility as a Use allowed
               by Special Use Permit in the "BP-2" Business Park District.

               Community           Development           Director      Amy      Starck     gave     a   summary        of the     Staff report        to   the
               Commission. A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department.
               She explained that the Petitioner is requesting to add an Indoor Limited Recreational Facility to
               the "BP-2" Business Park District as a Use allowed by Special Use Permit and noted that it is
               neither a Permitted Use nor a Use allowed by Special Use Permit in the district. The Commission
               was reminded that this Petition is in conjunction with the following case which is a request to
               operate      an   Indoor Limited Recreational                  Facility at a specific property;                however,        this   request
               should consider the appropriateness                     of the use        in the     district as     it would apply to            the   entire
               district.

               The Petitioner, Lynn and Aaron Becker approached.                                 Lynn Becker explained that they are the
               franchise owners of D-Bat. They saw an opportunity to bring this type of facility to Fenton and it
               will be the first one in Missouri. The Petitioners stated they had visited other locations in other
               districts but found a location in "BP-2" that fit the requirements of the franchise.

               The Commission discussed the location and purpose of the "BP-2" District, other properties and
               uses in "BP-2", and the appropriateness of the requested use to the district. They also discussed
               other districts where this use is permitted or allowed by SUP and their similarities to the "BP-2"
               District. Mayor Maurath stated that he struggles with amending the when this use may be located
               in seven other districts.

               Following discussion, Chairperson Yeoman made a motion to APPROVE CASE 2023-TXT-
               06 as drafted. Commissioner Wisbrock seconded the motion.

               Roll Call:

             7 Ayes; 1 Nay; 2 Absent:          Motion APPROVED


             CASE 2023-SUP-10: A Petition by D-Bat Academics for a Special Use Permit to operate an
             Indoor Limited Recreational Facility at 2130 Bowles Avenue. The property is addressed as
             1297 North Highway Drive and is zoned "BP-2" Business Park District.

             Community       Development       Director    Amy     Starck   gave    a summary       of the   Staff report     to the
             Commission. A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department.
             She stated that this request is in conjunction with the previous case requesting the use be allowed
             by Special Use Permit in the "BP-2" District.

             The Petitioner, Lynn Becker, expressed that St.              Louis is a baseball city and Fenton is an ideal
             home for the proposed facility. Ms. Becker explained the proposed franchise, D-Bat Academics,
             will host    baseball    and   softball   training   and   camps     as well    as have     batting   cages    to rent.
             Additionally, the facility will host tournaments that will bring people to the area. D-Bat will also
             offer a retail space selling baseball and softball equipment in partnership with Rawlings, adding
             that purchases can be made without using the facility or can be made online. The retail component
             of the facility will not cause any traffic concerns.

             Lindsey Neighbor, Senior Director of Marketing with Rawlings approached. She explained that
             D-Bat is a good representative of the Rawlings Brand and is the first business partnership that
             Rawlings has entered.

             The Commission discussed traffic flow into the area as                  this is housed in an office/warehouse
             building. Billy Spence, Newmark Zimmer and agent for the Petitioners, explained they evaluated
             the feasibility of the proposed facility         in this type of building adding that truck traffic will be
             rerouted around the striped parking area to prevent any issues.

             Following discussion, Chairperson Yeoman read aloud the conditions of approval. The Petitioner
             agreed to all.

             Conditions of Approval:
                   1. This   Special Use     Permit is    solely for   D-Bat Academics, to         operate    an Indoor Limited
                      Recreational Facility at 2130 Bowles Avenue as indicated on plans dated June 12, 2023.
                  2. Minimally, an Occupancy Permit will be required before the space is occupied. The site
                      plan shall be amended to indicate the required number of Accessible spaces in compliance
                      with Section 4 3 0 .140 before Occupancy will be issued.
                  3. Municipal Zoning Approval (MZA) by the City of Fenton and a Building Permit from St.

                8 Ayes; 0 Nays; 2 Absent:                 Motion APPROVED


                CASE 2023-TXT-07: Consideration of amendments to Chapter 430, Article V of the Zoning
                Code related to Special Events.

                Community          Development           Director      Amy       Starck     gave     a summary          of the      Staff report       to   the
               Commission. A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department.
                She explained that as the Code is written now, some public attraction events may be exempt from
               a Special Event Permit if certain requirements are met (less than 48 hours and no inflatables or
               mechanical/amusement devices proposed).                            Staff is requesting to            remove these types of events
               from the exemption since they can potentially draw large crowds that may cause parking, traffic,
               and other safety concerns. Staff is also requesting to add Food Truck Events to the definition of a
               Public Attraction. After discussion, the Commission amended the term "Food Truck Events" to
               "events centered around Food Trucks" for clarity.

               Chairperson Yeoman made a motion to APPROVE CASE 2023-TXT-07 with the suggested
               amendment. Secretary Abbott seconded the motion.

                         CASE 2023-TXT-08: Consideration of amendments to Section 420.010 Land Use Matrix of
                         the Zoning Code related to Outdoor Storage Area of vehicles associated with a dealership
                         that is not located on the same premises.

                         Community                     Development                       Director              Amy           Starck            gave         a     summary                 of the            Staff report                  to     the
                         Commission. She explained that this use was added as a SUP to the "BP-3" District in 2017, valid
                        for one year, to allow K&K Supply to lease a portion of their property to Beyerly RV to store
                        RVs during peak times of the year. As the SUP has not been renewed since 2019, it is requested
                        that the use be removed from the Land Use Matrix.

                        Alderman Harrell notified the Commission that his brother works for K&K Supply, and while he
                        feels this would not prevent his ability to vote impartially, he would recuse himself from the vote
                        in the interest of transparency.

                        Following discussion, Chairperson Yeoman made a motion to APPROVE CASE 2023-TXT-
                        08 as drafted. Commissioner Nelson seconded the motion.
