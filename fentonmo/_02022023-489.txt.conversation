Clauss, Chairman (Cruts, Harrell, Jokerst)\n\u2022    Consideration of a request for an agreement with NCR Payment Solutions to provide credit\n     card/debit card reader services.\n     Staff is    requesting the Board to sign an agreement with NCR Payment Solutions for the Fenton\n     Municipal Court to accept credit card transactions at the court window. Currently, if defendants come\n     to the court window to make a payment towards their case, they are only able to pay by cash, check or\n     money order. If defendants want to make a payment by credit card, they must submit their plea ofguilty\n     documents. The Court Staff will enter the information into the case management system and then the\n     defendants can go online to www.courts.mo.gov to make a payment. When defendants pay online\n     through the above system, the payment is already processed by NCR Payment Solutions and then\n     transferred to City's bank account.\n\n     NCR Payment Solutions provides payment services and EMV readers at no cost to the courts and\n     municipal clients. The provider will install EMV reader devices that would connect to our existing\n     network and train Staff. All payments are updated to the portal in real time. Payments for debit or credit\n     card transactions will be routed to the Show-Me-Courts account. Payments will settle to the bank\n     account within two (2) days.\n\n     A copy of the agreement, along with an addendum, with NCR Payment Solutions was available for\n     review.\n\n     Court Administrator           Lauren      Rabbitt     shared     currently     on court      night,   approximately         half of the\n     defendants attempt to make their payment via credit/debit card and are unable to do so. Some are able\n     to make cash payments or leave to obtain funds and return that night. If payment is not made court\n     night, court staff notifies defendant via phone or mail that payment can be made online via credit/debit\n    card or pay in person with cash, check or money order.\n\n     Alderman       Wisbrock        asked     if credit    card    reader     approved       who     would     pay    service     fee.   Court\n    Administrator Lauren Rabbitt replied, the service fee, based on amount of payment, would be paid by\n    the payee. There is no cost to the Municipal Court.\n\n    Alderman        Jokerst asked        for   clarification on        page    one    (1) of the      security     agreement,       Merchant\n    requirement to ensure compliance with cardholder data security and storage requirement and maintain\n    fraud     and   chargebacks        below     thresholds.      Jerry    Wingate,      Account       Director with        NCR Payment\n    Solutions, (via Zoom Videoconference), stated it is responsibility for PCI compliance (provided at no\n    charge): the card reader is encrypted and information is not stored on reader. Alderman Jokerst asked\n    for clarification on page two (2) sales method percentage. Mr. Wingate replied, anticipated percentage\n    of volume cards and how payment is made and can be adjusted as needed. Alderman Jokerst asked on\n    page four (4) on difficultly to update contact information. Mr. Wingate replied, notification request\n    would need to be submitted.\n\n    Mayor Maurath inquired on fees. Mr. Wingate replied fees are based on Missouri state contract pricing\n    using the service.\n\n                                                                              2\n                                                          Board of Aldermen Committee Meeting,\n                                                                      February 2, 2023\n\f\n      Alderman         Cruts     made     a   motion      to   forward      to   the   February      Board      of Aldermen         meeting      the\n      consideration of the request for an agreement with NCR Payment Solutions to provide credit card/debit\n      card reader services. The motion was seconded by Alderman Jokerst.\n\n      City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner advised the City Attorney does have concerns regarding the terms\n      of agreement. City Attorney Erin Seele expressed she has concerns, as it is not City form contract, it\n      contains a confidentiality provision and,                   noting subject to Sunshine, City has a stronger provision\n      regarding Sunshine if the City even considers a confidentiality provision.\n\n      City Attorney Erin Seele further noted NCR did remove most attorney fees and waiver of sovereign\n      immunity.\n\n      City Attorney Erin Seele advised of concerns regarding Exclusivity, noting \"Merchant shall not receive\n      services, or enter into an agreement to receive services, from any other entity\" as the City currently has\n      contracts with other providers. If the City were named a party rather than the Municipal Court, it would\n      be a breach of the agreement. She advised the agreement needs to be with the Municipal Courts not the\n      City. Mr. Wingate stated the agreement could be exclusive to the Municipal Court.\n\n      Upon a vote being taken, it was announced that the motion was passed by the Committee.\n\n\u2022     Consideration of amendments to Article XI, Offenses Concerning Alcohol and Drugs, of the\n      Municipal Code in compliance with Amendment 3 to the Missouri Constitution.\n      A draft Bill for amendments to the City's Municipal Code related to Amendment 3 of the Missouri\n      Constitution (Marijuana) for consideration was available for review.\n\n      One item that may require some discussion by the Board is the City's ability to authorize smoking\n      marijuana in public places, should they choose to do so (See Section 7, subsection A).\n\n      City can authorize marijuana use ift hey want to within certain areas ----\n            (6) Local governments may enact ordinances or regulations not in conflict with this section or with\n           regulations enacted pursuant to this section. governing:\n                       (a) the time andplace where marijuana may be smoked in public areas within the locality;\n                       and\n                       (b) the consumption ofmarijuana-infused products within designated areas, including the\n                       preparation ofculina,y dishes or beverages by local restaurants for on-site consumption\n                       on the same day it is prepared.\n\n     Alderman Jokerst inquired if public use is prohibited how would that be enforced. Captain Kevin\n     Lawson shared protocols are in place and awaiting further guidance from the State.\n\n     After discussion, Alderman Cruts                   made     a motion to forward to the February Board of Aldermen\n     meeting the consideration of amendments to Article XI, Offenses Concerning Alcohol and Drugs, of\n     the Municipal Code in compliance with Amendment 3 to the Missouri Constitution as written. The\n     motion was seconded by Alderman Jokerst.                       Upon a vote being taken, it was announced that the motion\n     was passed by the Committee.\n\n\u2022    Consideration of an agreement renewal with Flock Group, Inc. for License Plate Readers and an\n     agreement renewal with the Gravois Bluffs TDD to fund ten (10) of the License Plate Readers.\n     Currently the City has a one-year agreement with Flock Group, Inc. for a total of twenty-one (21)\n     License Plate Readers in the City, as approved by Ordinance 4083 and amended by Ordinances 4108,\n     4193, and 4215. The agreement is set to expire at the end of March 2023.\n\n                                                                                 3\n                                                             Board of Aldermen Committee Meeting,\n                                                                         February 2, 2023\n\f\n       Per Flock, renewal for another one-year term for the twenty-one (21) LPRs will be at the same cost as\n      2022 at $2,500 per camera, or $52,500.\n\n      It   is also     noted    that the      City    has    an   agreement (via Ordinance                 4207)     with the      Gravois      Bluffs\n      Transportation Development District (TDD) to fund ten ( 10) of the License Plate Readers that are\n       located in and near the Gravois Bluffs shopping development. Said agreement is also set to expire on\n       March 31, 2023 unless extended by both parties (The City and the TDD). Staff contacted the TDD\n       representative in early January to see if they want to extend the agreement for another year and per the\n      TDD representative, they desire to renew for another term.\n\n      At this time,         Staff is seeking direction from                 the Board regarding a desire to                   renew     both of the\n      agreements. There will be staggering invoices for cameras as the billing is based on the installation date\n      of each camera.\n\n      Alderman Jokerst asked Captain Kevin Lawson if he felt all twenty-one (21) cameras were needed.\n      Captain Kevin Lawson replied yes and further noted he received approval from MoDOT for cameras\n      to be located in their right-of-way near Gilsinn Lane/South Highway Drive and near Rudder Road and\n      is awaiting approval from St. Louis County for installation of two (2) cameras in their right-of-way.\n\n      City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner shared City is working to obtain cost share agreements from other\n      businesses.\n\n      Alderman Cruts clarified ten (10) cameras are to remain located in the Bluffs.

It was also noted that those eleven ( 11) cameras, can be relocated\n      if deemed necessary at a relocation cost of $400 per camera.\n\n      Alderman Maserang inquired if the City had received any Sunshine requests for Flock data footage.\n      City Attorney Erin Seele replied yes. Captain Kevin Lawson further stated footage is retained for thirty\n      (30) days.\n\n      Captain Kevin Lawson shared an overview of investigative/lead successes that Flock cameras have\n      assisted with, both by Fenton Precinct and other agencies.\n\n      It was further discussed that the reports showing the number of photos taken by each camera did not\n      need to be brought to the Board, but the Board did want to know if a camera was not working and the\n      issue was not being resolved.\n\n      After discussion, Alderman Cruts made a                          motion to       forward to the February Board of Aldermen\n      meeting the consideration of an agreement renewal with Flock Group, Inc. for License Plate Readers\n      and an agreement renewal with the Gravois Bluffs TDD to fund ten (10) of the License Plate Readers.\n      The motion was seconded by Alderman Jokerst.

City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner clarified the proposed removed duties of the\n     Community Develop Department, which were added to the City Administrator job description as\n     there was no Community Development Director, as per the Code they are to be performed by a\n     Director. Now those duties have been assigned back to the Community Development Director job\n     description as that position has been filled. Mayor Maurath inquired if the Parks liaison should be\n     on the Recreation Supervisor job description. Public Works Director Dan Howard suggested not at\n     this time and reconsideration could be given after an employee has been in that position more than\n     one (1) year. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner added that duty has always been previously\n     performed by a Director.\n\n\u2022   City Clerk - Alderman Jokerst stated education requirement needs to be added, it was suggested\n     high school diploma or equivalent. Alderman Huels suggested the Mayor \"Prepares job offers in\n     conjunction with Department Heads and City Administrator\" not the City Clerk.\n\nAlderman Cruts inquired on bullet point on all job descriptions \"other duties as assigned\", he feels that\ncovers all and inquired if it was necessary to list temporary/non-daily tasks on job descriptions. City\nAttorney Erin Seele explained essential functions are the fundamental and crucial job duties that an\nemployee must be able to perform with or without reasonable accommodations to get that job done and\ndo not include marginal functions, extra, or incidental duties which are covered by \"other duties as\nassigned\". Essential job functions aid         in the process of selecting legal and appropriate interview\nquestions, aid in consideration of request for reasonable accommodations, are referred to for workers\ncompensation cases, fit for duty testing, and return to work testing.\n\n    Mayor Maurath was not in favor ofthe suggestion. Mayor Maurath inquired on how Board directive\n    votes, such as monies to be spent, are followed upon and check and balance duties to verify they\n    are   completed.     City   Clerk   Jane    Hungler    replied   depends     on   directive,   typically   within\n    minutes/agendas and City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner replied with policies.\n\n\u2022   Community       Development       Director    -  Mayor     Maurath     suggested     changing    \"oversees\"     to\n     ''prepares\"   as position    is Director.    Mayor Maurath asked          for clarification of \"Administers\n    enforcement      of the    Fenton    City   Code.    including     policy   on   non-defined      issues\".   City\n    Administrator        Nikki     Finkbiner      explained      per     the    Code,     the    Director      makes\n    decision/determination to interpret the intent of the Code. Alderman Jokerst inquired when\n    would there be a situation this position would oversee and obtain alternative funding through\n    grants. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner replied it was done by previous Directors. Mayor\n    Maurath inquired on duty of \"Maintains records of code enforcement activities for study of\n\n                                                              s\n                                             Board of Aldermen Committee Meeting,\n                                                       February 2, 2023\n\f\n      possible revisions\". City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner replied it allows for review activities\n      for consideration for regulation updates needed such as numerous sign variances and changing\n      to a sign plan.\n\n\u2022     Code Enforcement Officer - Mayor Maurath suggested adding flex hours to address issues that\n      may be occurring in the early mornings, evenings, or on weekends.\n\n\u2022     Court Administrator - no additional changes recommended.\n\n\u2022     Assistant Court Administrator - Alderman Jokerst suggested capitalizing \"Show Me Court\" for\n      consistency.\n\n\u2022     Permit Coordinator - Aldennan Jokerst suggested removing requirement for driver's license as it\n      seemed driving is not essential requirement of position. Alderman Wisbrock and Alderman Cruts\n      voiced they were not in favor ofremoving requirement for driver's license. Following discussion,\n      it was agreed to remove requirement.\n\n\u2022     Maintenance Worker III - Alderman Jokerst inquired if requirement for high school diploma or\n      GED was necessary. Public Works Director Dan Howard stated that he feels it is as they supervise\n      other employees.

Mayor Maurath inquired on \"Leads and participates in the\n      maintenance, repair, improvements, and construction ofconcrete streets, approaches, sidewalks,\n      swales, and curbs throughout the City\", he feels City crews do not perform repairs to streets. Public\n      Works Director Dan Howard replied they would if Department was fully staffed. Mayor Maurath\n      inquired on \"minor repairs of traffic signals\".                    Public Works Director Dan Howard shared they\n      replace signs on traffic signals and assist in minor repairs such as lights. Mayor Maurath asked if\n      they perform sanitary sewer cleaning. Public Works Director Dan Howard replied performed within\n      the park system and City buildings. Mayor Maurath inquired if Maintenance I and Maintenance II\n      workers were also required to               \"acquire and maintain a chemical applicator's license\".                          Public\n      Works Director Dan Howard replied no, requirement is to have two (2) employees certified with\n      that license to      purchase and knowledge of how to apply and use of equipment. The licensed\n      employee can train the unlicensed employee.\n\n\u2022    Maintenance Worker II - Mayor Maurath shared this position requires replacing concrete and\n     asphalt and Maintenance Worker HI did not. Public Works Director Dan Howard replied they do\n     perform that duty. Mayor Maurath inquired if three (3) years related work experience should be\n      lowered.

Mayor\n     Maurath inquired on \"one {I) year experience in public works,                               construction, or related field\".\n     Public Works Director Dan Howard shared \"\"desired\" can be added, if they have the experience, it\n     is an advantage as it is important to the job.

When defendants pay online through the above system, the payment is already processed by NCR Payment Solutions and then transferred to City's bank account.\n\nNCR Payment Solutions provides payment services and EMV readers at no cost to the courts and municipal clients. The provider will install EMV reader devices that would connect to our existing network and train Staff. All payments are updated to the portal in real time. Payments for debit or credit card transactions will be routed to the Show-Me-Courts account. Payments will settle to the bank account within two (2) days.\n\nA copy of the agreement, along with an addendum, with NCR Payment Solutions was available for review.\n\nCourt Administrator Lauren Rabbitt shared that currently on court night, approximately half of the defendants attempt to make their payment via credit/debit card and are unable to do so.

Alderman Jokerst asked for clarification on page two (2) sales method percentage. Mr. Wingate replied, the anticipated percentage of volume cards and how payment is made and can be adjusted as needed.

Mr. Wingate replied fees are based on Missouri state contract pricing using the service.\n\nAlderman Cruts made a motion to forward to the February Board of Aldermen meeting the consideration of the request for an agreement with NCR Payment Solutions to provide credit card/debit card reader services. The motion was seconded by Alderman Jokerst.\n\nCity Administrator Nikki Finkbiner advised the City Attorney does have concerns regarding the terms of the agreement. City Attorney Erin Seele expressed she has concerns, as it is not the City form contract, it contains a confidentiality provision, and, noting subject to Sunshine, the City has a stronger provision regarding Sunshine if the City even considers a confidentiality provision.\n\nCity Attorney Erin Seele further noted NCR did remove most attorney fees and waiver of sovereign immunity.\n\nCity Attorney Erin Seele advised of concerns regarding Exclusivity, noting \"Merchant shall not receive services, or enter into an agreement to receive services, from any other entity\" as the City currently has contracts with other providers. If the City were named a party rather than the Municipal Court, it would be a breach of the agreement. She advised the agreement needs to be with the Municipal Courts not the City. Mr. Wingate stated the agreement could be exclusive to the Municipal Court.\n\nUpon a vote being taken, it was announced that the motion was passed by the Committee.\n\nConsideration of amendments to Article XI, Offenses Concerning Alcohol and Drugs, of the Municipal Code in compliance with Amendment 3 to the Missouri Constitution.\nA draft Bill for amendments to the City's Municipal Code related to Amendment 3 of the Missouri Constitution (Marijuana) for consideration was available for review.\n\nOne item that may require some discussion by the Board is the City's ability to authorize smoking marijuana in public places, should they choose to do so (See Section 7, subsection A).\n\nCity can authorize marijuana use if they want to within certain areas\n\n(6) Local governments may enact ordinances or regulations not in conflict with this section or with regulations enacted pursuant to this section, governing:\n\n(a) the time and place where marijuana may be smoked in public areas within the locality; and\n\n(b) the consumption of marijuana-infused products within designated areas, including the preparation of culinary dishes or beverages by local restaurants for on-site consumption on the same day it is prepared.\n\nAlderman Jokerst inquired if public use is prohibited how would that be enforced.

There will be staggering invoices for cameras as the billing is based on the installation date of each camera.\n\nAlderman Jokerst asked Captain Kevin Lawson if he felt all twenty-one (21) cameras were needed. Captain Kevin Lawson replied yes and further noted he received approval from MoDOT for cameras to be located in their right-of-way near Gilsinn Lane/South Highway Drive and near Rudder Road and is awaiting approval from St. Louis County for the installation of two (2) cameras in their right-of-way.\n\nCity Administrator Nikki Finkbiner shared the City is working to obtain cost-share agreements from other businesses.\n\nAlderman Cruts clarified ten (10) cameras are to remain located in the Bluffs. Captain Kevin Lawson replied yes and ten (10) of the cameras will be located in other various areas of the City, with one (1) camera located on the radar trailer. It was also noted that those eleven (11) cameras can be relocated if deemed necessary at a relocation cost of $400 per camera.\n\nAlderman Maserang inquired if the City had received any Sunshine requests for Flock data footage.
