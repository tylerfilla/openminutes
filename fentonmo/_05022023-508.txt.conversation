A   copy   of the PowerPoint\n           presentation is attached for the record and copies of corresponding documents provided to the\n           Commission are on file with the Community Development Department.\n\n           Director Starck explained the Overview, Goals, and Objectives of the Olde Towne Planning Area.\n           She noted that the current Comprehensive Plan includes the Olde Towne area and the commercial\n           areas of the City into one Planning Area designation, and Staff is proposing that these areas be\n           divided into separate Planning Areas as they are very different.      As this area encompasses the\n           original 8 blocks,   attention has been   paid to its historic significance   with regard   to future\n           redevelopment. She also pointed out the unique mix of commercial and residential developments\n           in the Planning Area.\n\n           The Commission discussed the Olde Towne Redevelopment Plan adopted in 2000 as well as more\n           diverse housing   (multi-family, apartments,   etc.). Director Starck noted   that the Olde   Towne\n           Redevelopment Plan and Multi-Family/Apartment developments rely            on there being available\n           land within the Planning Area to redevelop, which is currently not the case. Mayor Maurath noted\n           that because this area is prone to flooding, it is good that develo'pment in this area hasn't been\n          pushed. He also mentioned that there have been new single-family homes built in the area with\n          more to come. Additional discussion was held regarding residential dwellings in non-residential\n          areas. Director Starck noted that residential dwellings in certain non-residential areas would need\n          to comply with the Zoning Code as well as the Comprehensive Plan.\n\n          Discussion was held regarding the lack of parking in the Olde Towne area and how that impacts\n          future redevelopment. Director Starck noted that this Planning Area seeks to encourage pedestrian\n          traffic and small-scale businesses to address the lack of parking,\n\n          Following discussion, Chairperson Yeoman called an additional workshop session at 6:00 p.m. in\n          advance of the July 11, 2023 meeting to discuss amendments to the remaining Planning Areas of\n          the Comprehensive Plan.\n\n  ADJOURNMENT:           6:57 p.m.\n\n          A motion to adjourn was made by Chairperson Yeoman and seconded by Commissioner Nelson.\n          The motion was unanimously approved by voice vote.\n\n          Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n\n          Amy Stigtk         .~\n                                                                 C~irperson-\n          Community Development Director                         Planning and Zoning Commission\n\f\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3:\nc.~\nC'0        C\n~ QJ\n+\"        E\nC        \"\"C\nQJ         C\n\"-         QJ\n:l        E\nu        <(\n\f\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      6/5/2023\n\n\n\n\n\n        Commercial Planning Area                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Business and Industrial Planning Area\n\n                                                                                                                                                                  3.

A copy of the PowerPoint presentation is attached for the record and copies of corresponding documents provided to the Commission are on file with the Community Development Department.\n\nDirector Starck explained the Overview, Goals, and Objectives of the Olde Towne Planning Area. She noted that the current Comprehensive Plan includes the Olde Towne area and the commercial areas of the City into one Planning Area designation, and Staff is proposing that these areas be divided into separate Planning Areas as they are very different. As this area encompasses the original 8 blocks, attention has been paid to its historic significance with regard to future redevelopment. She also pointed out the unique mix of commercial and residential developments in the Planning Area.\n\nThe Commission discussed the Olde Towne Redevelopment Plan adopted in 2000 as well as more diverse housing (multi-family, apartments, etc.). Director Starck noted that the Olde Towne Redevelopment Plan and Multi-Family/Apartment developments rely on there being available land within the Planning Area to redevelop, which is currently not the case. Mayor Maurath noted that because this area is prone to flooding, it is good that development in this area hasn't been pushed. He also mentioned that there have been new single-family homes built in the area with more to come. Additional discussion was held regarding residential dwellings in non-residential areas. Director Starck noted that residential dwellings in certain non-residential areas would need to comply with the Zoning Code as well as the Comprehensive Plan.\n\nDiscussion was held regarding the lack of parking in the Olde Towne area and how that impacts future redevelopment. Director Starck noted that this Planning Area seeks to encourage pedestrian traffic and small-scale businesses to address the lack of parking.\n\nFollowing discussion, Chairperson Yeoman called an additional workshop session at 6:00 p.m. in advance of the July 11, 2023 meeting to discuss amendments to the remaining Planning Areas of the Comprehensive Plan.\n\nADJOURNMENT: 6:57 p.m.\n\nA motion to adjourn was made by Chairperson Yeoman and seconded by Commissioner Nelson. The motion was unanimously approved by voice vote.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nAmy Starck Community Development Director Chairperson- Planning and Zoning Commission"}]
