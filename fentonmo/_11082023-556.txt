     NEW BUSINESS:

                 CASE 2023-SUP-16: A Petition by Kang Na, owner of Little Tokyo, Inc d/b/a Sushi and K Fusion
                 for a Special Use Permit for Outdoor Dining at 515 Gravois Road. The parcel is addressed as 503
                 Gravois Road and is zoned "OT-1" Olde Towne District.

                 City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner gave a summary of the Staff report to the Commission. A copy of the
                 Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department. She explained that the Petitioner is
                 seeking to operate a restaurant on the lower level of the building that is currently vacant. As a part of the
                 restaurant operation, the Petitioner is proposing outdoor dining within the patio area that has been used for
                 the same purpose as past restaurants at this location.

                 City Administrator Finkbiner noted that there                         is an existing prefabricated              building once used            by   Bales
                 Auto Sales that is non-conforming. She added that there is nothing on file with the City indicating that this
                 building was ever approved to be located on the lot. The current Code does not allow for more than one
                 principal     building per lot          in this district,      so   Staff is    requesting the        building be        removed       as part of the
                 conditions of the requested SUP.

                 The Petitioner, Kang Na, approached. He explained that he intends to have the building removed and has
                 contacted a contractor to get an estimate of price and timeline to do so but is still awaiting that information.

                 Additional discussion was held regarding an appropriate timeframe for removal of the building. Following
                 discussion,       the   conditions       of approval         were     amended        to require      the    non-conforming           building      to   be
                 removed within five (5) months of approval of the SUP.

                 Vice-Chairperson Sherrel read aloud the conditions of approval. The Petitioner agreed to all.

                 Conditions of Approval:

                                   removed from the property within five (5) months of the approval of the Special Use Permit.
                             4.    If alcohol is to       be served in the outdoor dining areas, the Petitioner will need to obtain any
                                   required liquor licenses through the City Clerk.
                             5.    Compliance with all other applicable City Codes and Ordinances.
