In order to apply for the grant, the City must have selected a planning firm with a quote and\n         scope of services to provide planning services to develop the Master Plan.\n\n        Based on the above, a Request For Proposals for Park Planning Services was advertised by the City in\n                                                                                                                                      st\n         early May, with a deadline to submit proposals by May 31                                                                        .\n\n        The proposals were received by the following planning firms:                                                                               Gateway Design Studio, LLC, TWM,\n         Inc., Planning Design Studios, and SWT Design and were available for review. At this time, it                                                                                                                           is\n        requested that the Parks and Recreation Committee review the proposals to assist in selecting a firm\n        for the planning project and make a recommendation to the Board of Aldermen.\n\n        City         Administrator Nikki                            Finkbiner shared                         in    2020 the               Committee reviewed                               planning firms for\n        Comprehensive Park Plan project and                                                       Planning Design Studios was selected                                                     by      the Committee,\n        however the project was not moved forward. In 2002 the City used SWT Design for a Comprehensive\n        Park Master Plan that was never adopted. Gateway Design Studio, LLC, TWM, Inc. also appear to\n        have good qualifications. Once a selection is made, negogiations could occur regarding final                                                                                                                      costs\n        and        scope          of work               and        presented              to     the       Board           for final             approval              for      a    contract that                  will        be\n         incorporated into the grant\n\n        Mary Heinemann inquired on the Board of Aldermens support and commitment to impleminting a\n        Master Plan for the Bud                                    Weil Annex Property if Committee makes                                                             recommendation                         to    move it\n        forward, as the 2002 Comprehensive Park Master Plan was not adopted or implemented. Alderman\n        Huels expressed she would pose the question to the Board and further advised the Committee on\n        development limitations for the Bud Weil Annex Propery as there are no water or sewer lines, the\n        lake, connections to Fabick Nature Preserve and a large area of steep hill. City Administrator Nikki\n        Finkbiner further shared the City purchased the Bud Weil Annex Property in 2014 property is not\n        deed restricted, it was purchased mainly to provide access points to the Fabick Nature Preserve as the\n        Fabick property is deed restricted.\n\n        After discussion, Chairman Johnson suggested topic was continued to the July meeting to allow the\n        Committee time to review proposals for selection. There were no objections.\n\n\u2022       Discussion regarding Municipal Parks Grant Commission Construction Grant.\n\n                                                                                                                 2\n                                                                                  Parks and Recreation Committee Meeting\n                                                                                                        June 5, 2023\n\f\n     As discussed with the Committee earlier this year, the Municipal Park Grant Commission opened the\n     next round of funding for a Construction Grant on June 15\\ with a deadline of August 28, 2023.\n\n    This grant can be used for park renovations including: playgrounds, water parks, golf courses, trails,\n    recreation centers, ice rinks, etc. No cost match required, but an extra point for 5% match can be\n    obtained within the grant.      The maximum award is population based at $315,000.                The City has been\n    awarded 3.3 grants in the past (partial award due to the collaborative 1-44 Bridge Greenway grant\n    with Kirkwood and Sunset Hills) at a total award amount of $437,595.                     As an example, the Olde\n    Towne Pavilion was constructed with funding awarded under the Construction Grant.\n\n    It is noted that the purpose of the competitive grant is to fund projects that would not otherwise be\n    implemented without the funding; therefore, a project selected for the grant cannot be listed in the\n    City's Capital Plan that was available for review.\n\n    Based on the above, and noting that time is of the essence do to the application deadline, if the\n    Committee would like for the City to apply for funding, a project will need to be selected as soon as\n    possible.   To   assist   in selecting   a   project, the    most   recent   published    annual   report   from   the\n    Commission outlining projects that were funded under Round 22 in 2021 was available for review.\n\n    Audrey Wattler suggested Meramec Greenway trail connection. Mary Heinemann suggested waiting\n    until next year to      allow time    to review    Bud    Weil Annex      Plan   if approved.    Chairman Johnson\n    suggested parking and restrooms near the Olde Towne Pavilion.\n\n    After discussion, Chairman Johson suggested the topic be continued to next year to allow project\n    selection. There were no objections.\n\n\u2022   Discussion regarding Missouri Department of Conservation Community Forestry Cost Share\n    Program.\n    Staff has contacted the Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC) regarding funding under the\n    Community Forestry Cost Share Program.                Noting that the City already provides funding for the\n    removal of dead and diseased trees under the Capital Plan, it was suggested that the City consider\n    applying for funding under the Forestry Program to hire a                 professional service to provide a tree\n    inventory.    The tree inventory will assist the City with identifying and prioritizing trees that need to\n    be removed due to disease and/or decay or due to the invasive nature of the tree.                  Additionally, the\n    tree inventory is usually completed within an asset management database or GIS format that is then\n    provided to the City upon completion of the survey so that progress can be easily tracked.\n\n    Per MDC, the requests for the next round of funding under the Community Forestry Cost Share\n    Program will begin on July 1, 2023.            It is noted that applicants that apply at the beginning of the\n    funding round have a better opportunity of receiving funding.\n\n    The maximum funding allowed under an application is $49,000 per year, with a 50/50 cost share\n    (example: if awarded $49,000 by MDC, the City must provide $49,000 in cash or in-kind services\n    toward the project).      However, due to the number of applications received by MDC, it is suggested\n    that the application have a max request of $25,000 to be more competitive (likely to receive funding).\n\n    Per MDC, quotes will         also need to be obtained from         a professional contractor that provides tree\n    inventory services and provided with the request for funding.\n\n\n\n                                                            3\n                                           Parks and Recreation Committee Meeting\n                                                        June 5, 2023\n\f\n     Based on the above, should the Committee desire that staff apply for funding under the Community\n     Forestry Cost Share Program for a tree inventory of public trees, a recommendation regarding the\n     same will need to be forwarded to the Board of Aldermen.\n\n     After discussion, Mary Heinemann made a motion to recommend applying for funding under the\n     Missouri Department of Conservation Community Forestry Cost Share Program for a tree inventory\n     of public trees. Audrey Wattler seconded the motion.\n\n          5 Ayes; 0 Nays, 2 Absent, 0 Abstain:           Motion APPROVED by voice vote.\n\n\u2022    Discussion      regarding       Missouri      Department        of   Conservation        Community         Conservation\n     Assistance Program.\n     As requested by the Committee, Staff contact MDC to discuss funding options to implement the\n     Master Park Plan for Fabick Nature Preserve.               Per MDC, the recommendation is that the City start\n     with   applying     for invasive     specifies   control,    specifically   honeysuckle,      within    the park    before\n     submitting for other project funding.\n\n     Per MDC, the best funding opportunity for invasive species control will be under the Community\n     Conservation Assistances Program and MDC will                    begin accepting requests for the next round of\n     funding under this program on July 1, 2023.               Applicants that apply at the beginning of the funding\n     round have a better opportunity of receiving funding.\n\n     The maximum funding allowed under an application is $49,000 per year, with a 50/50 cost share\n     (example: if awarded $49,000 by MDC, the City must provide $49,000 in cash or in-kind services\n     toward the project).        The project application will consist of the City requesting funding to hire a\n     professional service to remove the invasive species in areas identified within the proposed scope of\n     work.\n\n     Staff can work with MDC to identify areas that need invasive control and will assist in prioritizing the\n     areas before the application is submitted; however, due to the extensive invasion in the park, requests\n     for funds will most likely need to occur over multiple grant rounds.\n\n     Per   MDC,     quotes    will also    need   to be    obtained    from    a professional     ecological/environmental\n     contractor that provides        invasive   species    management services,         along with the areas        of priority\n     identified, within the request for funding.\n\n     Based on the above, should the Committee desire that staff apply for funding under the Community\n     Conservation      Assistance     Program     for   invasive    species   removal     in Fabick     Nature     Preserve,    a\n     recommendation regarding the same will need to be forwarded to the Board of Aldermen.\n\n     After discussion, Mary Heinemann made a motion to recommend applying for funding under the\n     Missouri Department of Conservation Community Conservation Assistance                            Program for      invasive\n     specifies control, specifically honeysuckle. Audrey Wattler seconded the motion.\n\n          5 Ayes; 0 Nays, 2 Absent, 0 Abstain:           Motion APPROVED by voice vote.\n\nMEMBER REPORTS:\n\u2022   BUD WEIL/BUD WEIL ANNEX - There was nothing reported.\n\u2022   MERAMEC GREENWAY - Chairman Johnson reported looks good, crews progressing on river\n    bank cutting.

Mary Heinemann seconded the motion.\n\n    5 Ayes; 0 Nays, 2 Absent, 0 Abstain: Motion APPROVED by voice vote.\n\nPUBLIC COMMENTS: There were no public comments.\n\nOLD BUSINESS:\n\u2022 Discussion regarding a bathroom in Fabick Nature Preserve.\nDuring the February 6th Meeting, the Parks and Recreation Committee requested that Staff gather additional information regarding options for a restroom at Fabick Nature Preserve, specifically a cost estimate for a pre-fabricated structure.\n\nDue to difficulties obtaining estimates to remodel the existing building, the Board of Aldermen approved going out for formal bids in May. The bid opening is scheduled for June 15th and the results of the bid, along with estimates for a pre-fabricated building will be presented to the Committee in July.\n\nNEW BUSINESS:\n\u2022 Discussion regarding Municipal Parks Grant Commission Planning Grant. As recommended by the Committee and approved by the Board, Staff has begun applying for the Municipal Park Grant Commission Planning Grant for a Master Plan for the Bud Weil Annex Property as it is undeveloped.\n\nAs a reminder, the application for the grant is revolving throughout the year (no deadline); however, the maximum funding available per project is $10,000, with the City providing a minimum 20% cost-share. In order to apply for the grant, the City must have selected a planning firm with a quote and scope of services to provide planning services to develop the Master Plan.\n\nBased on the above, a Request For Proposals for Park Planning Services was advertised by the City in early May, with a deadline to submit proposals by May 31st.\n\nThe proposals were received by the following planning firms: Gateway Design Studio, LLC, TWM, Inc., Planning Design Studios, and SWT Design and were available for review. At this time, it is requested that the Parks and Recreation Committee review the proposals to assist in selecting a firm for the planning project and make a recommendation to the Board of Aldermen.\n\nCity Administrator Nikki Finkbiner shared in 2020 the Committee reviewed planning firms for Comprehensive Park Plan project and Planning Design Studios was selected by the Committee, however the project was not moved forward. In 2002 the City used SWT Design for a Comprehensive Park Master Plan that was never adopted. Gateway Design Studio, LLC, TWM, Inc. also appear to have good qualifications. Once a selection is made, negotiations could occur regarding final costs and scope of work and presented to the Board for final approval for a contract that will be incorporated into the grant\n\nMary Heinemann inquired on the Board of Aldermens' support and commitment to implementing a Master Plan for the Bud Weil Annex Property if Committee makes a recommendation to move it forward, as the 2002 Comprehensive Park Master Plan was not adopted or implemented. Alderman Huels expressed she would pose the question to the Board and further advised the Committee on development limitations for the Bud Weil Annex Prop[e]rty as there are no water or sewer lines, the lake, connections to Fabick Nature Preserve, and a large area of steep hill. City Administrator Nikki Finkbiner further shared the City purchased the Bud Weil Annex Property in 2014; the property is not deed restricted, it was purchased mainly to provide access points to the Fabick Nature Preserve as the Fabick property is deed restricted.\n\nAfter discussion, Chairman Johnson suggested the topic was continued to the July meeting to allow the Committee time to review proposals for selection. There were no objections.\n\n\u2022 Discussion regarding Municipal Parks Grant Commission Construction Grant.\nAs discussed with the Committee earlier this year, the Municipal Park Grant Commission opened the next round of funding for a Construction Grant on June 15, with a deadline of August 28, 2023.\n\nThis grant can be used for park renovations including: playgrounds, water parks, golf\ncourses, trails, recreation centers, ice rinks, etc. No cost match required, but an extra point\nfor 5% match can be obtained within the grant. The maximum award is population based\nat $315,000. The City has been awarded 3.3 grants in the past (partial award due to the\ncollaborative I-44 Bridge Greenway grant with Kirkwood and Sunset Hills) at a total award\namount of $437,595. As an example, the Olde Towne Pavilion was constructed with\nfunding awarded under the Construction Grant.\n\nIt is noted that the purpose of the competitive grant is to fund projects that would not\notherwise be implemented without the funding; therefore, a project selected for the grant \ncannot be listed in the City's Capital Plan that was available for review.\n\nBased on the above, and noting that time is of the essence due to the application deadline,\nif the Committee would like for the City to apply for funding, a project will need to be\nselected as soon as possible. To assist in selecting a project, the most recent published\nannual report from the Commission outlining projects that were funded under Round 22\nin 2021 was available for review.\n\nAudrey Wattler suggested Meramec Greenway trail connection. Mary Heinemann suggested\nwaiting until next year to allow time to review Bud Weil Annex Plan if approved. Chairman\nJohnson suggested parking and restrooms near the Olde Towne Pavilion.\n\nAfter discussion, Chairman Johnson suggested the topic be continued to next year to allow \nproject selection. There were no objections.\n\n\u2022 Discussion regarding Missouri Department of Conservation Community Forestry Cost Share\nProgram. Staff has contacted the Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC) regarding\nfunding under the Community Forestry Cost Share Program. Noting that the City already\nprovides funding for the removal of dead and diseased trees under the Capital Plan, it was\nsuggested that the City consider applying for funding under the Forestry Program to hire a\nprofessional service to provide a tree inventory. The tree inventory will assist the City with\nidentifying and prioritizing trees that need to be removed due to disease and/or decay or due\nto the invasive nature of the tree. Additionally, the tree inventory is usually completed within\nan asset management database or GIS format that is then provided to the City upon\ncompletion of the survey so that progress can be easily tracked.\n\nPer MDC, the requests for the next round of funding under the Community Forestry Cost Share\nProgram will begin on July 1, 2023. It is noted that applicants that apply at the beginning of\nthe funding round have a better opportunity of receiving funding.\n\nThe maximum funding allowed under an application is $49,000 per year, with a 50/50 cost share\n(example: if awarded $49,000 by MDC, the City must provide $49,000 in cash or in-kind services\ntoward the project). However, due to the number of applications received by MDC, it is suggested\nthat the application have a max request of $25,000 to be more competitive (likely to receive funding).\n\nPer MDC, quotes will also need to be obtained from a professional contractor that provides tree\ninventory services and provided with the request for funding.\n\nBased on the above, should the Committee desire that staff apply for funding under the Community\nForestry Cost Share Program for a tree inventory of public trees, a recommendation regarding the\nsame will need to be forwarded to the Board of Aldermen.\n\nAfter discussion, Mary Heinemann made a motion to recommend applying for funding under the\nMissouri Department of Conservation Community Forestry Cost Share Program for a tree inventory\nof public trees. Audrey Wattler seconded the motion.\n\n    5 Ayes; 0 Nays, 2 Absent, 0 Abstain: Motion APPROVED by voice vote.\n\n\u2022 Discussion regarding Missouri Department of Conservation Community Conservation\nAssistance Program. As requested by the Committee, Staff contact MDC to discuss funding\noptions to implement the Master Park Plan for Fabick Nature Preserve. Per MDC, the\nrecommendation is that the City start with applying for invasive species control, specifically\nhoneysuckle, within the park before submitting for other project funding.\n\nPer MDC, the best funding opportunity for invasive species control will be under the Community\nConservation Assistance Program and MDC will begin accepting requests for the next round of\nfunding under this program on July 1, 2023. Applicants that apply at the beginning of the funding\nround have a better opportunity of receiving funding.\n\nThe maximum funding allowed under an application is $49,000 per year, with a 50/50 cost share\n(example: if awarded $49,000 by MDC, the City must provide $49,000 in cash or in-kind services\ntoward the project). The project application will consist of the City requesting funding to hire a\nprofessional service to remove the invasive species in areas identified within the proposed scope of\nwork.\n\nStaff can work with MDC to identify areas that need invasive control and will assist in prioritizing the\nareas before the application is submitted; however, due to the extensive invasion in the park, requests\nfor funds will most likely need to occur over multiple grant rounds.\n\nPer MDC, quotes will also need to be obtained from a professional ecological/environmental\ncontractor that provides invasive species management services, along with the areas of priority\nidentified, within the request for funding.\n\nBased on the above, should the Committee desire that staff apply for funding under the Community\nConservation Assistance Program for invasive species removal in Fabick Nature Preserve, a\nrecommendation regarding the same will need to be forwarded to the Board of Aldermen.\n\nAfter discussion, Mary Heinemann made a motion to recommend applying for funding under the\nMissouri Department of Conservation Community Conservation Assistance Program for invasive\nspecies control, specifically honeysuckle. Audrey Wattler seconded the motion.\n\n    5 Ayes; 0 Nays, 2 Absent, 0 Abstain: Motion APPROVED by voice vote.\n\nMEMBER REPORTS:\n\u2022 BUD WEIL/BUD WEIL ANNEX - There was nothing reported.\n\u2022 MERAMEC GREENWAY - Chairman Johnson reported looks good, crews progressing on river bank cutting.
