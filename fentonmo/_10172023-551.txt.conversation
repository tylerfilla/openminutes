Persons taking the Oath were Amy Starck, Community Development Director, Dan\n             Wind, and Phil Reynolds via Zoom videoconference.\n\n    OLD BUSINESS:\n\n             CASE 2023-V-04:          A Petition by Phil Reynolds of Bulk Transport Company East, a\n             subsidiary of TFI International, for Variances from                    Section    415.200(E)(2) of the\n             Zoning Code to        enlarge an existing non-conforming Off-Street Parking Area that\n             encroaches the required 20-foot front and 10-foot side landscaped Buffer Areas, and\n             Section 430.080 to allow an alternative paving surface (crushed stone) for the Off-\n             Street Parking Area in lieu of the required asphalt or concrete.\n\n             Director Starck stated that all was in order for the Case to be heard.\n\n             Petitioner Phil Reynolds, appearing via Zoom videoconference, and Dan Wind of Wind\n             Engineering     approached.     Mr.   Wind    explained     that the   case   was   continued    from    the\n             September meeting to allow Petitioner to study the request from the Board to remove part\n             of the parking lot to provide a landscaped area. He said they would be able to remove 15\n            feet from the front of the parking lot, re-stripe, and move the fence in order to meet the 20'\n            buffer requirement. He also stated they will maintain the buffers on the rear and side along\n            the   expansion.     Member       Mooney      then    asked    the Petitioner     about    the   floodplain\n            Development Permit and if it was approved. Mr. Wind responded that they have not filed\n            anything beyond the variance to see what this outcome would be. Member Rogers stated\n            that he was happy they were getting more green space and still thinks the crushed stone\n            would be the best for the floodplain because of the draining aspect.
