               CASE 2023-SP-01: A Petition                      by Dale Sign Service on                 behalf of America's Best Contacts and
               Eyeglasses for a Sign Plan at 180 Gravois Bluffs Circle, Suite A. The property is zoned "C-1"
               Commercial District.

               Community          Development            Director      Amy       Starck     gave     a   summary         of the      Staff     report    to    the
               Commission. A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department. She
               explained that the Petitioner is proposing two Wall Signs, one on the front fac;ade and one on the rear
               fac;ade,    for America's         Best    Contacts       and    Eyeglasses       in   Gravois     Bluffs.     The    front    Wall    Sign    will
              exceed the 5% allowed when wall signs are proposed on more than one facade, but the rear sign will
              not. The Petitioner also included other proposed signage in the Sign Plan that were found to meet the
              requirements and do not need any permit or review under the Sign Plan.

              The Petitioner, Chris Smith of Dale Sign Service, approached. Vice Chairperson Sherrel read aloud
              the conditions of approval. The Petitioner agreed to all.

              Conditions of Approval:
                    I.   The    approval       is for America's Best Contacts                  and    Eyeglasses       at   180   Gravois Bluffs         Circle,
                         Suite A for two (2) proposed Wall Signs as indicated in plans submitted with the application
                         and dated January 26, 2023.
                   2.    Municipal        Zoning Approval             by   the   City of Fenton and             Sign Permits         issued     by   St. Louis
                         County will be required for the proposed Wall Signs.
                   3.    Compliance with all other applicable City Codes and Ordinances.

             Commissioner Voorhees                    made      a motion        to APPROVE              CASE 2023-SP-01 with                   the   three     (3)
             conditions read into the record. Alderman Harrell seconded the motion.

                CASE 2023-TXT-02: A Petition by Katrina McDonald Fuller to amend Section 420.010 Land
                Use Matrix of the Zoning Code to allow Medical Office as a use allowed by Special Use Permit
                in the "HP-1" Hospitality Park District.

                Community           Development           Director       Amy       Starck      gave     a   summary         of the       Staff report        to   the
                Commission. A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department. She
                explained that the Petitioner is seeking to locate a Medical Office providing behavioral health services
                in an existing building in the "HP-1" District. As a Medical Office is not a permitted use in "HP-I",
               the Petitioner is proposing to amend the Land Use Matrix to allow the use as a Special Use Permit in
               conjunction with the next item on the agenda, Case 2023-SUP-04.                                      Community Development D1rector
               Amy Starck read the purpose of the "HP-1" District to the Commission.                                             It was discussed that this
               amendment would affect the entire "HP-1" District, not just the specific site, and how such did not
               seem to meet the purpose of the district.

               The     Petitioners,        Katrina      McDonald           Fuller      and     Quincy       McCoy,        approached.          The     Petitioners
               summarized their proposed use and explained the reason they chose to locate in the "HP-I" District is
               because it is centrally located with high visibility. The Commission discussed that while there is a
               need for mental health services, there are many other districts that allow Medical Offices. It was stated
               that the Commission has                 considered carefully the               uses within the Land Use Matrix over the past
               several years and feel the most appropriate uses for this district are those that support hospitality. In
              her absence, Commissioner Nelson provided the Commission with a letter in opposition to the Text
              Amendment.            Vice    Chairperson         Sherrel      read    the   letter aloud       to   those     in attendance. The            letter   is
              attached to minutes for the record.

              The     property       owner,      David      Kulaski,       approached.         Discussion        was     held    regarding       the   difference
              between Medical Office and Medical Facility, which is permitted by                                           SUP in the district. Director
              Starck provided definitions for both uses and explained that Medical Facilities are more intensive uses
              such as      diagnostic        centers,     laboratories,       and    urgent care facilities.            Based on the          information and
              statements provided by the applicant, the proposed use falls under the definition of a Medical Office.

              Following discussion, Commissioner Wisbrock made a motion to APPROVE CASE 2023-TXT-
              02. Alderman Harrell seconded the motion.

                 CASE 2023-SUP-04: A Petition by Compass Health Network for a Special Use Permit to operate
                 a Medical Office at 964 South Highway Drive. The property is zoned "HP-1" Hospitality Park
                 District.

                City Attorney Erin Seele reminded the Commission that even                                         though the        Text Amendment was
                denied, the Commission should evaluate this request based on the criteria for issuing a SUP set by the
                Code.

                Community           Development           Director       Amy       Starck      gave     a   summary         of the      Staff     report     to   the
                Commission. A copy of the Staff report is on file with the Community Development Department. She
                explained that the proposed                 Medical       Office will        offer behavior health services within the 9,711-
                square-foot tenant space. Staff reviewed the required parking for the existing uses on the parcel as
                well as the proposed Medical Office. Based on the information provided by the Petitioner regarding
               the number of staff members on-site over the course of the day, the minimum parking can be met. The
               petitioner explained that staff would be going out into the community for case management and would
               use this location as a hub to make phone calls, answer emails, and other similar tasks. Additionally,
               there may also be IO to 15 patients on site to learn daily living skills at this location.

               Following        the    discussion,       Vice     Chairperson         Sherrel     read     aloud     the   conditions       of approval.        The
               Petitioner agreed to all.

               Conditions of Approval:
                     1.   This Special Use Permit is solely for Compass Health Network, to operate a Medical Office at
                          964 South Highway Drive.
                     2.   Minimally, an Occupancy Permit will be required before the space is occupied.
                     3.   Municipal Zoning Approval (MZA)                          by the City of Fenton and a Building Permit from St.
                          Louis County will be required for any proposed interior remodel.
                    4.    Compliance with all other applicable Code and Ordinance requirements.

               Commissioner Wisbrock made a motion to APPROVE CASE 2023-SUP-04 with the four (4)
              conditions read into the record. Commissioner Voorhees seconded the motion.

                The Petitioner has requested this matter be continued to the next Planning and Zoning Commission
                meeting.


                CASE 2023-TXT-03: Consideration of amendments to the Zoning Code to aJJow Comprehensive
                Marijuana Dispensary Facilities as a Use allowed by Special Use Permit in additional districts in
                the City.

                Community          Development           Director      Amy      Starck      reminded       the    Commission          that   in   January      they
               recommended approval of amendments to the Code related to Marijuana Businesses as suggested by
               staff with a revision that Dispensary Facilities be allowed by SUP in the "C-1" District only. At the
               January       12,   2023     Board     of Alderman          Committee         meeting,      the   Board      amended       the   Commission's
               recommendation to include dispensaries in "HP-I" and "OT-2" as originally recommended by staff.
               The Board also made a motion to have Staff investigate additional districts to allow Dispensaries
               Facilities as a SUP. Staffs original recommendation was based on those districts that allowed Medical
               Marijuana Dispensaries and those that allow similar retail uses (liquor stores). Based on this, Staff
               does not recommend expanding Marijuana Dispensaries in any additional districts at this time.

               Mayor Maurath, stated for the record that while he did vote to approve the recommendation to only
               include dispensaries in "C-1" at the January Commission meeting, after considering the characteristics
               of the     districts     more     and    listening      to   further     discussion,       he   feels    "HP-I" and          "OT-2"       are   also
              appropriate locations for dispensaries. He agrees with Staffs determination to not expand at this time.

              Following additional discussion regarding other districts, Secretary Abbott made a motion to
              NOT EXPAND Comprehensive Marijuana Dispensary Facilities                                                  in additional districts under
              CASE 2023-TXT-03. Alderman Harrell seconded the motion.

Dear Planning and Zoning Commission members,
I am unable to attend tonight's meeting but would like to share my thoughts
regarding case 2023-TXT-02: A Petition by Katrina McDonald Fuller to amend
Section 420.010 Land Use Matrix of the Zoning Code to allow Medical Office as a
use allowed by Special use Permit in the "HP-1" District.
The City allows medical offices in many of it is districts and in keeping with the
Comprehensive Plan the HP-1 District does not. Please consider keeping HP-1 as
an area for hospitality and retail establishments. Several times in the past years
we have discussed the Land Use Matrix and have kept HP-1 for retail and
hospitality industries. I do not endorse even changing the code to allow this
usage with a special use permit.
Please consider my opinion that we should not change the zoning code.
Thank you.
Linda Nelson
P&Z Commissioner.
